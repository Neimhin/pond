0,2021-05-29,"  Alberta higher proportion right wing nutters rest Canada? Sure, right wingers kind think vote Conservative they'll able make $150k oil patch again. Annoying sure, usually pretty harmless. 

Ultimately, Canada, vaccine subject conspiracy theories might US, definitely partisan issue. Alberta right wing government Canada, reopening measures completely tied percentage people get vaccinated.


(by way, ever see someone reddit speaking entirety Canada, they're probably Toronto talking ass) Except state restricted travel definitely thing happened almost 50 states. lot people year ago saying that, theory mostly media debunking. Due time factors, muddled together ""lab leak"" general. spill animal reservoir still likely explanation.

But based response, doubt let facts get way personal opinions.

You probably want hear 'China bad'.

Maybe are. right that's opinion. What? Aside melted permafrost, would novel virus come climate change?  Expiry dates never *exact* begin with. people first learned Covid late January 2019. still thought Chinese problem affect us probably.  Masks ability increase number IC's quickly. Also better isolation patients nursing homes. Good luck one... according recent national population census 2020, r around 850，000 foreigners mainland China right now. number supposed bigger considering put pandemic. 


However redditors prefer believing ppl actually live Worse side effects initial vaccine second. Everyone know took mRNA vaccines prior COVID rid long-covid symptoms weeks first shot, second shot much symptoms.  


That's tradeoff I'd every single time. Even fastest scenario would take 3 months test vaccine, know works.

Then vaccine rollout would take 6 months.

So would still 6 9 months lockdowns begore getting control Iceland 29 deaths. that's country 350.000.

And still better European countries well US.

But Singapore HK amazing job everyone needs look regarding pandemic pretty much gold standard. UK sent covid infected elderly back care homes.

We contingency plan pandemic kind, even though slap bang top risk register.

Just two fundamentals learn from, god rocket science. Anyone made 55k less state cumulatively made money unemployment today worked. Stimulus top?

This virus first identified first wave pandemic already underway Wuhan. China certainly manhandled it, many countries also completely underestimate virus emerged.

It easy say 'why stop started'. countries still heavily denying bad untill hit hard. country get sabbatical? sabbatical paid? quit looking new job moment Lol, nice. would mind reading article check many cases r city? Go Bears! (I went schools, blasphemy, know...) would hybrid model like, exactly That's true. emerged matter that. 

Countries shut borders mid January first cases emerged would gotten rid Covid April may ""MS""? MS Yes, prepare next time things get much control again. countries (mostly Asian) shown pandemics contained controlled.

We need better detection, better healthcare, smarter politics impression— Canadians told Alberta like “the Texas Canada.” 

Good know you’re vaccines there. Yep, quite right! least made error sides equation ratio stands! 

I'll edit.

Cheers. Moderna purely American.

Technically case. development purely done Moderna (and therefore fully American), actual production outsourced. active component Moderna vaccine produced Lonza, biochem company Switzerland, produces things part US part Switzerland. components (such lipids) well fill-and-finish work also outsourced various companies. Alright, makes sense. refuse go back office full-time, I'm pushing WFH onto anyone else think working remote everyone. comment specifically missing commute, understand easy replicate improve. Unfortunately, part USA--and areas world--want specific answer accept answer fits conspiratorial belief system made lab. believe risks second dose even lower first dose... heard still blood clots less. phenomenon known now, treatable. go second dose Tuesday. 
However, feel really unconformable, could try fight mRNA.. potentially getting doctor certificate need shift, could local authorities flexible then? Eventually, populations build herd immunity. 

They hard way easy way. good thing outbreak increased uptake vaccine supply rather demand limited. Covid-19 7th Corona type virus emerge modern times. original Corona virus infected humans tens thousands years old.

This happen again. 

Perhaps previous Corona virusses infectious, may unlucky. maybe virus found fertile ground modern higly populated world.

Time tell variants 2-3 mutations (or essentially same). Israel isn’t even close number. Jesus Christ calm down. Belgium 93 percent vaccination rate 65- 85 age group, almost 91 percent older 85. UK percentage even higher. reassuring sign worst behind us. Ah, found supply chain logician. ""Just find way use them."" Brilliant! anyone else think that? ""leaked"" lab, virus found animals studying. pandemic could started lab, virus already existed nature, could still found way humans. start lab, likely studying viruses aware particular variants could cross humans.  everyone Alberta impression sort completely backwards society? 

[Alberta second highest vaccine uptake per 100,000 every province Canada, behind That’s smart analogy. 

It’s emotionally satisfying, perhaps, smart. 

We’re trailing well documented paths UK, US, Israel. We’re likely keep improving / keep approaching now. That’s normal. feel sore kinda like bruise injection site. December 2019, cases pneumonia associated unknown coronavirus reported health authorities Wuhan. institute checked coronavirus collection found new virus 96% genetic similarity RaTG13, virus researchers discovered horseshoe bats southwest China.[18][19

Said bats side country, contact Wuhan could via institute held samples them.

That causation Different virus, family (if coronavirus cold, low percentage anyway).

So body might mount quicker response maybe fight better, immune. like bringing toothpick knife fight. 

To immune, need vaccine. missed mine Might busy something else maybe. dunno tho. J&amp;J vaccine (which one makes sense tourists) costs $10 per dose. Buying enough doses entire world stuff would cost $70B, still fraction cost economical damage pandemic caused still causing.

Compared costs reduced international trade tourism, vaccines damn cheap pointless nickle-and-dimeing pays what. Without modern medicines hospitals broken everywhere, thing would soo much worse.

Or started killing 20 30 year old, like Spanish flu did.

Honestly bad (and still is!), we've extremely lucky could easily ten times worse. next pandemic may forgiving. hope + vaccine rollout finally end US travel ban EU. Many people think tourism, know kept families, couples apart 14 months, frozen visas people put hard work into. can't go like this. Sorry, small edit: 0.03%, 0.0003. 

Not 0.0003%. Probably masses people got asymptomatic COVID-19. 

Coronaviruses like 5-20% (don't remember) yearly cold viruses. one recently, might low level immunity SARS-COV-2 well. novel version, one real immunity it. somehow saying China climate change..? they're malicious enough release infectious virus intentionally, therefore ""proven"" can't climate change? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Allow introduce field Gain Function Research. general, kinda terrifies Unless using situation means attack others, accept faults.

That's reasonable statement make well.

If not, I'm going blame Marco Polo it, know, Reddit anything state definitely true.  No, need react fast well stop it.

As long DECIDE LET RUN, fault choice. process making paramedics (and possibly licensed pharmacists) legally able perform vaccinations motion.

At moment doctors nurses (and dentists special authorization) legally able so, now, practically doctors performing jabs. Yes - antibody tests.

Your doctor draw blood send in. buy test-kits well, don’t know good are.

Here Europe antibody tests doctors expensive - cost around 20€ + fee drawing Blood (if insurance doesn’t cover it) Well, since got mRNA one carrier vector one, chance blood clots extremely low. check article, note small fraction total amount doses (about 0.3%) goes bad. unopened boxes sitting shelf go bad, rather leftover doses vials end day.

Once opened, vial must fully used within hours, exact number people getting shot given day fully use vials, leftovers can't realistically ship anywhere. Early vaccination campaign, many places could put doses arms people list volunteers leftover doses, pretty much everyone wants shot one US still getting first dose longer wait leftovers end day.

So amount waste inevitable, insanity.  Yeah it'd adults, anyone get vaccine qualify.

I mean they're planning spending almost $120 million this, even sub $1000 surprised much people would change tune something easy vaccine hundred bucks. alternatively may incorrect.

Then sad valid reason?
And blame bunch people something actually happen.

How know difference two? sad maybe something happened?

I know sounds silly.

Problem may never know. deal us decide. tend want see optimistic side things. thought Pfizer pushing fill 10 (11?) well.

What need single pre-filled doses tail end vaccinations wasting vials single dose someone walks in, going back appointments grouped.  certainly didn’t enjoy part team caring 17yo boy got double lung transplant due covid. Completely preventable could’ve vaccine. problem third estimated. infected develop antibodies longer term immunity (most do).

What measure vaccine doses. odd pandemic rear head (but 'begin') cosmopolitan area near types virusses occur naturally.

Just 'coincidentically' cosmopolitan area also reasonable location lab researches types viruses.

Now lab leak impossible, people put B together immediately assume caused B.

That's necessary since non causal relationship two already exists. lab is, that's obvious location it. Dunning Kruger effect. people say need get vacinated reading this. disagree. developing country incompetent honest PM. managed keep real low.

Our neighbours got cunning yet apathetic leader. worst hit country covid right now.  examples people I'm exactly position (26F). first AZ dose law changed advise 30's offered different vaccine. Feel cornered as, understand risk super low, choice either taking second dose therefore fully vaccinated, dose something I'm particularly comfortable with. Alberta? really want find truth, create blame-free environment. work there's problem; nobody gets fired making mistake. gotta figure happened make happen again.

If threaten assign blame people, they're going hide evidence fault, start pointing finger people. Italy’s health Care system isn’t bad Lmaoooo saying. actually think anything biden question whose fault was? achieve?

Will sleep better blame China maybe blame great country Ghubloobbkoob?

We need learn prevent future pandemics. That's all.  vaccinated would protected, might 100% effective survival rate non protected already 99.7%, vaccine 95-99% effective imagine much brings fatality rate. think current vaccine tested long term, know dangerous vaccine date terms cardiovascular problems, also Pfizer admitted vaccine could cause infertility women (look up), producers vaccine immunity even believe product top cases insurance companies paying premiums deaths related vaccine covered policy. bringing points together someone might take vax, risk others minimal risk individual much greater taking typical vax.  Wait, someone please clarify me, people fly US...to get vaccine? quarantining traveler/s, work???  What's circumstantial evidence?  see problem. US keeps banning vaccine raw materials exports even demand dropping fast. honestly failed see connection national day would good idea open border. Canada already stated would open 75% population get 1 dose (which almost case) 20% double doses 👍

Well written response. Uhm, no?

Actually, we'd need look failed stopping virus. we'd understand this, we'd act differently next time.

I understand quite traumatic people feel powerless. However, actually powerless. prepare all. people keep thinking we're prepared. aren't.

We prepared lab-grown virus, well. We're still prepared either lab-grown accidental viruses. I'd say 3 years now, nothing changed that.

Covid-19 emerged people willing masks. emerged people thinking could go work crowded trains, lock childen schools. Wow, gave extremely well written response, including sources.

And dismiss hand, doesnt fit narrative.

I respect contributions USA made getting pandemic control.

But friend blind man. both? undercounting number viruses cross humans. COVID-19 third coronavirus cross humans less 20 years. would've look like did, ""gain function research"" regards purposely making viruses transmissible otherwise dangerous study them.

As Wikipedia put it: ""Gain function research term used describe field medical research alters organism disease way increases pathogenesis, transmissibility, host range."" travel Michigan give vaccine. need US citizen. one checking ID hope know hoarding means..the unvaccinated people uneducated self entitled population’s issue. request full cavity search TSA never take Pretty sure reason liberals planning summer election, want border open political nightmare Americans come Canada Canadians can't go US.

Canada open border gets 20 percent full vaccination, bet.

Won't long based vaccination rates, another month two. US sharing massive stockpile can't use would certainly help. ""We leaked lab  /s "" - China 

There, I've cut end you. 

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously, China leak not, good opportunity international banning research weaponize viruses pathogens. We've seen mild virus world, especially we're much connected (ie Spanish flu), longer theoretical discussion necessary one keep us safe prosperous. coronavirus spillover animals past, default assumption spillover too.  kind job work can’t take day off?

A shitty one. ain't coming back. Pfizer 6-7 doses per vial. Moderna 10. Two arms beast: rich. Everyone required wear N95s. Masks work.  Hoarding? Kiss ass. paid billions vaccines still unvaccinated people. Taiwan buy weapon US China opposes. Taiwan buy AZ Moderna without problem... China stop Taiwan buy Pfizer successfully? evidence hint evidence, conjectures. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there's several things came out, credible source, like WSJ article 3 researchers hospitalized covid-symptoms, China refuses cooperate, genetic sample COVID-10 ones lab 96% identical (per lab director) What’s worked effective, it’s still absolutely necessary fight variants strong, suppressive measures.

Low testing creates artificial decline.  say it’s modi’s fault? event, even India didn’t face crisis, would still face vaccine shortage like 70% countries world.

They’re criticising Modi article, they’ve mentioned multiple times. Modi doesn’t equals India. Get first. 

Here’s account Modi’s blunders: blocked vaccine exports order prioritize vaccinating citizens—simply grabbing vaccines meant others. threatening wreck global COVAX program meant ensure equitable vaccine distribution help poor nations, creating risk prolonged pandemic whole August 2020, Modi grandly declared India already worked vaccine distribution plan. Yet, **he placed first vaccine order late January 2021**. And, even then, bought little. result: time second wave hit India full intensity April, 0.5% Indians fully vaccinated. national leader talked much vaccines done little it, Indians ones paying price maker Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine accounts 90% Indian COVID-19 doses, **slotted supply half 2 billion vaccines COVAX year**. stopped shipments since March says can’t restart supplies end year. Serum Institutes’s global supplies hold, **uncertainty looms 92 low-income lower-middle-income countries depending COVAX**. Even find new suppliers, months vaccines materialize. Serum Institutes’s cop-out means COVAX short 190 million doses end June.

Depending major donors are, donors decide speak out. speak bully tactics, pulled funding not. media requires funding big players, cater players keep good light. 

It really breaks big players, big business. need keep income flow, still league big players. order this, media used way keep face. long companies get negative publicity keep face. 

A good example ""made america"" campaign. Lets look construction industry that. many ""American"" brands, Dewalt. Upon closer inspection may see companies boast ""made america"". recently added label, ""made america global materials"". cheeky way saying ""assembled america"". certain supplies even say made. Using molds made america. bits, screwdrivers, blades.

So companies keep facades like media attention aspect almost every part company made america. either made Hong Kong (china\*), China, Korea, recently Brazil. would shocked see major media outlets exposé power tool internals made.

This slice biased media run. extremely complicated also global players now. globalization major driving force markets today, players longer patriotic country bound. hold responsibility country origin, although exist end paying massive premium.

Simply vaccine made US, mean USA owns vaccines. clauses Original Pfizer contract, still clauses Moderna contract kept/keep companies exporting fullfill certain/their commitments US first.  benefit US, manufacturers, bet Moderna would rather able use US production supply contracts opposed possibly falling short contracts commitments. Don’t sides this. It’s one side that’s politicizing it. cop move. Short answer .. none idea. I'm shoure.boosters needed winter..  Less vote republicans there’s silver lining. Good point. still skewed. Canada wants US. else new? Hilarious. ""guinea pigs"" argument gets less less convincing world gets safely vaccinated. really irrational people clinging argument make seem rational. long vaccines potentially *last* now? 7 months instead 6? putting comparison USA, Europe (as continent) EU here. two base arguments actual data.

Cumulative case death vaccination throwing article well. get rid narrative data EU, Europe worse coming US. reason difference. “India says stand children lost one parent coronavirus pandemic pay upbringing. government unveiled mammoth target days warning human traffickers targeting vulnerable kids.”   Totally!! also really like free college lottery states encourage 12-17 yr olds get it.

Incorrect. Many colleges requiring it. (See article) Yeah we're still going get need enough people going get shots choice enough. wearing FFP2s(N95s). big stumbling blocks, addition supply, waiting period second shots consistency vaccine rollout AstraZeneca pause (I.e.

Yeah Q Japan too, weird public mass transportation. them, give us London, Canada would extend border give us great lakes well. It’s common journalistic style *Reuters* (which published article), *The Guardian*, *The Independent* use. also use “bn” billion “trn” trillion.

Meanwhile I’m encouraging everyone know simply stop wearing they’ve vaccinated. hospitals exception flu shots. Get shot wear mask 100% shift. plain surgical masks. Could similar Covid vaccine require N95s full shift. Hospital ID badges labeled either “I’m vaccinated” colored line you’re unvaccinated.

I also recognize isolation kids experienced pandemic fucking horrible. Kids need kids. 

However, big one, drives nuts hear people implying putting kids back school magically solve mental health crisis kids facing right now. 

I relative keeps flogging line everything fine kids go back school *everything back normal*. 

It's magic wand. 

First all, I'd bet box popsicles (the good kind) person school exactly going back normal. adjustments policies routines. increased anxiety kids random coughs colds allergies. Covid probably still going long shadow. 

But even setting aside, kids whose mental health taken hit last year half need *help*. putting back school erase stress trauma. 

There shit ton kids developed legit mental illnesses families may equipped (financially way) handle. Pediatric therapists psychiatrists long waiting lists quarantine. probably ton younger kids delays undiagnosed ADHD might caught teachers counselors, parents notice. undoubtedly fuck ton kids get necessary school-provided services (speech therapy OT). 

Shit's fucked, y'all.

I agree article: impending crisis way prepared.  richest industrialised country planet. y'all excepting insurance based healthcare?

Second doses coming now. 1/4 daily new vaccinations second doses Restrictions partially fully lifted across much country good bit time. We’ve gotten Easter Mother’s Day surges. Don’t see Memorial Day would different it’s holiday generally celebrated outdoors anyway means learn much emerged. Also remember ignorant actions many people politicians helped fuel crisis. I’m NY see almost one unmasked indoors stores. Restaurants seem opened broadly though many full capacity. Lol, last time checked Liberals charge while. Nice try. Fuck 'em (not literally though - never stick dick crazy (is female equivalent? fuck idiots? Idk)). I've reading, FDA approval realistically looking like 2023, earliest. curious, hear approval would pass less 1 year, time universities add mandated vaccination list? or, misunderstanding referring EU schools US? That’s pharmaceutical companies said people called “synthetic opioids aren’t addictive!” bullshit. 

That alone enough atleast give pause mandating brand new medical treatment provided big fail pharmaceutical corporations.  Nice. Ethics  Please read wrote. said testing. specifically said testing. either go back forth twice stay US extended period. I'm NYC, ending restrictions July 1st. plan while. May 31st curfew removed indoor places 24 hour 4 return. excuse, there's still plenty benefit getting least one dose vaccine including broader stronger neutralization variants.

Yep, I'm glad live age that's got vaccines nasty things used happen people yep, occasionally bad things happen good intentions... already thought nut job 'vagina testing' cemented it. One thing always spread easily hate. Unless decoration full hate, doubt spread on. completely agree, lot companies base decisions fear, rather logic lol. benefits exceed risk larger margin (i.e. years data reinforce already know), ""scared"" HR groups going take leap unless impact disease clearly outweighs vaccine's liability.  Might good time spend summer looking remote work elsewhere August rolls around (if wish remain remote). people handing resignations day get called back office.

I've read India wastage average 6.3% much 37% one state. sure countries achieving cannot expect zero wastage. Well 1% seems reasonable ...to read them. 80% people available vaccines Quebec vaccinated point...

So else want do?  There's lot entertainment venues/TV film studios I'm sure testing constantly. doubt rural areas higher hesitancy, statewide voting patterns overwhelmingly Democrat seems clear vast majority population Dem-aligned. Sure, maybe Republican states might bother voting, gets far. think urban-rural divide explains enough vaccination unless whole bunch Dem-aligned hesitant people, rural otherwise. “He said performance mandatory masking successful enough would contemplate least continuing periodic usage combating virus diseases, influenza.”

Ya know- universal comparison Covid? own, comes risk assessment v distrust/conspiracy theories   know little GBS know symptoms triggered actually cold flu, vaccines. vaccines used actual viruses them, thing would trigger live environment. covid shots don't.

Definitely listen doctors GBS experts, say risky unknown still dont wait safe (and really hope get herd immunity going) coming across comment knowing different mRNA vaccines vaccine we've ever seen...it make sense would odd ones out! think would've different honest. would course better maybe like Europe completely crush first wave, end worse second third ones.

Oof. whatever he’s now, it’s hard forget Biden served conservative liberal nearly entire time government. may Democrat name tag, he’s strong republican long time. he’s pretty good, it’s hard trust. research done tests measure immunity/vaccine effectiveness. it’s possible point “never took it” least “not effective enough” could detected.

There absolutely zero chance enough people permanently altered behavior prevent significantly mitigate future pandemics. want changed behavior better hope cultural shift CDC et all. going find American public — global public matter! everyone risk able to.

Ye.. that. whole reason need reach herd immunity protect medically get vaccine, stop spread keep deal new variants popping one requires us less start over.

We forcing people take assume current uptake close enough correct. Yeah, that's China. Every country Earth handled things perfectly. /s Absolutely true propoganda opinion article.. mean technically US needs Canada. want lot more. maybe actions reason numbers stay low.

We hundreds thousand foreigners business China, live China, work China, counting thousands international companies operating China employees, factories, stores, etc.

It’s world’s second largest economy largest consumer market, it’s freaking North Korea.

If Covid still serious issue China everyone would know now. Who's forcing people get vaccination? would illegal. 5 cases? Wow amazing!

Slippery slope slides exactly?

I’m American 40+ year old show vaccination record, exception letter, every school attended handful workplaces. 

If slope, it’s covered slow ass taffy, slippery substance. Canada's strategy like US opens next age group way earlier UK does. UK government waiting age group get 95%+ vaccinated going next one - getting smaller percentage population vaccinated rather everyone society less vaccinated.

Its effective cutting deaths high risk groups basically fully vaccinated, means people 30 ate largely unprotected. Yeah, bad. annoying feel moment. got earlier walk make coffee nearly passed out, fine. No, still think argument Chinese economy freer market USA's stupid unsupported claim. That's good. need way able verify US vaccines border. Dum git dummer Imagine way pandemic like ""nah"" live that's right US. ""We know whats it!"" 

*swigs bleach cocktail* UK show jump back up... 70%+ vaccinated exponential increase cases Luckily company already announced mandating vaccinations unless government makes mandatory. They're also forcing people show vaccination cards; honor system.  

I appreciate that, someone naturally recovered covid. Studies showing promise life long antibodies, possibility future immunity and/or asymptomatic infection, like vaccine. vaccine probably still protects it, variant continue mutate enough quite different original covid-19, first generation vaccine might protect it.   Reasonable accommodations include forcing wear mask socially distance, keep remote. refuse wear mask socially distance could grounds fire long, really explain restrictions necessary long. mean they're rich country easily able vaccinate population  clear- CDC makes guidance based upon think going yield best positive results general American population's health make recommendations individual health/safety.

For examples- CDC initially recommended n95's healthcare works supply n95's available despite evidence airborne transmission.

The policy EVERYONE stop wearing masks. vaccinated people need wear masks believe stance going encourage people get vaccinated. wrong principle think ludicrous think going results either/or 1. unvaccinated people get vaccinated 2. unvaccinated people continue wearing masks entirely unenforceable recommendation everyone else drops them

At point adults vaccinated heavily skewed anti-vax crowd well people using political statement going change minds.... Suppression strategies leave hugely vulnerable countries fail suppress contagious lineages appear. suppressing *and* getting lot vaccines real quick successful point. Odd, pretty much within 30min registering online seems like kind power corporations use evil future. Bad idea. You’re supposed drink alcohol getting shot. big ass lump money pretty appealing motivator lot people. claustrophobic panic attacks whenever I'd wear mask minutes time, especially hot weather. local mandate dropped, anxiety seemed improve almost overnight. 

I think lot people have/had trouble masks kind anxiety sensory difficulty rather strictly physical side effects. think point it’s slippery slope imagine nothing done stop it. 

I’m arguing business won’t look interest expense workers. That’s exactly ruling class does. It’s expect do. that’s also need respond quickly things change. create laws assumption things go wrong build safeguards. Then, corporation finds way around safeguard, quickly act close whatever exploit they’ve found set things right. 

We already time. simply need get better accept expected behavior. reason, view law something enacted never changed (I’m rewriting actual constitution), stop this. Laws change conditions behaviors change. 

My problem isn’t even big business; it’s crappy politicians elect protecting us them. could children risks groups get doses prisoners want take? Dont like it, welcome leave! America, take public health seriously. Pregnant women reduced immune system response, carrying something 50% foreign DNA, small kids vaccinated. self proclaimed ""Right life"" crowd actually gave damn pregnant women, children, would ones mandating universal mask mandates. actions tell theater power grab, smug arrogance.

Praying country. 🙏 others.🙏 Israel 2.36 cases per million occurring daily, grand total 21 cases daily entire country.

The US 66.83 cases per million daily. two countries completely different state pandemic. public schools. lot private schools require it. that's also small children developed immune systems, adults do. even vaccine kids yet. holy shit, 5% positivity rate?!? That's really high! 0.5% positive Californian county weeks now. without vaccine, end businesses can't get back normal, investment that.

Shit, I'd OK giving everyone gets vaccine lot money means nightmare end. I'd rather live inflation constantly re-shutting enough people vaccinated. live Arizona keep track numbers daily. feel like death numbers seriously lagging actually happen. hospitalizations continuing go well daily cases. We're also steady 5% positivity rate. Perhaps lot old people live too, could factor. Also, vaccination percentage, though slowed, trucking along we're almost 47%. Definitely better 4 months ago. Booked honeymoon Feb 2022 Italy Croatia! Frankly...Didn't think soon would possibility. excited ability travel internationally again. employer prohibited smoking anywhere company property back 80's random drug testing.

No. Sorry, criticism Europe unfounded. USA able rollout vaccines weeks faster various reasons. Snd we're catching overtaking USA vaccinations rollout soon. 

I know Reddit likes narrative 'USA good, UK good, Europe bad'. facts barely support that. Heck important vaccine Pfizer European American. 

What Europeavdid wrong give bucketsof money companies creating vaccines, spend enough vaccine production. 

Still US total ban vaccine exports, Europe supplied lot countries. Including UK. 

Overall I'm proud Europe managed it. bit slow rollout first vaccines, we've done reasonably well. CNN *now* pretending truth important trashing Trump lol can’t expect everyone comply.

It already ruled anyone studied virus. Yep. desperate grift.

Someone’s clearly getting bitter 3 letter word J&amp;J 65% effective catching Covid, similar protection two shots Moderna Pfizer terms protecting even moderate Covid19 symptoms.

The 65% average; varies region (more effective Europe, less South Africa, possibly due new variant). Protection moderate serious Covid19 symptoms remains high though.

And Pfizer Moderna initially tested new variants field, J&amp;J was.

Given choice, I'd probably pick Pfizer, I'll happily take J&amp;J what's dinner. (Netherlands, here) Moderna delivery schedule degree Pfizer (neither AZ), time Pfizer started shipping US, suddenly Moderna's shipments started coming time—and extra shipments get caught faster. coming US, may reasons cagey it, thus unable release delivery schedule.

Have seen Contagion? suggests plausible route pathogen jump humans, destructive activities. Washington send 20m doses US-approved coronavirus vaccines overseas ***by*** end June, Joe Biden confirmed combination 60m doses AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine US already promised foreign allies, Biden administration send 80m vaccine doses abroad ***over*** next six weeks. like see people die needlessly dealing people, gave wish best. Natural selection help decision soon enough. official number 33m Americans infected

There's reason use official numbers know there's ~3x infections went undetected. Plus, good data mortality rate COVID-19. 0.45-0.5% US, get pretty close actual number infections simply dividing number deaths 0.5%.

With official death count, gives ~122M infected using [IHME's report excess deaths attributable COVID-19](http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths) get 183M. 

Finally, CDC estimates [115M Americans However, relies official death count know that's inaccurate. Well that's straight false. think HIPAA is? Health. Privacy. Act. Closest thing antibody test. hard come by, look local blood donation drives- early would offer free antibody testing donation. First doses get (and places barely even that). access second doses. observation based single article. don’t see entire world media punching India stopping exports.

You missed point. look article. 'The world pay'. world also paid western countries curb virus. time headlines mention I’d reckon many Indians idiolize west wouldn’t give chance settle got one.

They like opportunities, people lol. political viewpoint Indians never like West. want do? Hide reality? Put rose tinted glasses, praise supreme leader, jerk nationalistic historic videos, go bed call day?

I criticize text. criticized pictures attached. Show least 5 articles white people shown crying. Show I'll change mind. care much image country yet don’t want anything bring actual tangible changes ground

And made think that? donated money. sent free food everyone locality caught covid. dad mask business donated masks various NGOs. 

You write articles without attaching pictures people crying taken without permission. someone crying record put internet POS. Show news articles white person crying I'll change mind Let's put blame politization politicians; media help either. tho? world needs US reached herd immunity. 

The EU also announced donate 100m doses... Q4. others pointed right lack vaccine lack money buy vaccine that's problem. countries would happily pay get sometime soon. read too, positioned biological warfare Chinese developing. could get board escaping, engineered kill fat people. hit 85% end year.

It hard China convince rural residents take vaccines. still 600 million Chinese living countryside,  anything 70% would pretty hard. depends state - still 3 weeks. got second dose 3 weeks friend mine different state wait 6 weeks.

Yay federalism. I'm pro vaccine legal sh!t show making? rare scenario person adverse reaction vaccine find something couple months years road feel need sue company mandated it? new term injection.  kids got MMR jab, get flu jab every year. word used. many people confident last summer done covid? Covid back fall winter areas low vaccination rates may variant spreads even easily. NZ Australia proved good CCP students.Restricting human rights years insanely evil dangerous. fun lmao Pretty sure cover ass keep legal department happy. reality policy would everyone, regardless vaccinated not. Even rate isn’t high could they’ve still given enough shots fully vaccinate 1/3rd state. least cut fast virus spread. Source? Canada surpass US first doses?  don’t disagree saying let add this… It’s percent vaccinated, it’s even spread percentage. Say city 50% vaccinated. Everyone east side town vaccinated everyone west not. west decimated new variants east fine. news still report “the city” decimated. take 50% spread evenly. chance infection taking hold greatly minimized! blanketed herd immunity numbers wrong variable consider even pay attention to. good likelihood herd immunity reached low numbers given right places (ie. evenly, special focus high risk entry points). outsource even industry china

Do live 1990? China outsources industry SEA. China powerhouse now. Cool, question. Well said. isn't. ignoring CDC? Governor Texas literally went TV height pandemic told citizens needed put risk going back public spaces w/o vaccine die economy

That Lieutenant “No one reached said, ‘As senior citizen, willing take chance survival exchange keeping America America loves children grandchildren?’ exchange, I'm in.” Eh, herd immunity ideally 70% higher. 50% still leaves lot planks bridge virus hop across.

True. there's third US population got infected, there's least third remaining, un-vaccinated, population relative immunity. Possibly since reasonable assume refuse vaccine also likely adopted risky behavior gotten infected already and/or infected already likely believe need vaccine. 

That brings us close 70%. mark may moot variants, likely 75 even 80% required reach herd immunity.  You’re absolutely right! stating simplest measures need taken end current pandemic thwart outbreaks taking hold. chance happening selfish, instant gratification culture like US another thing. think it’s “zero chance”? No. would definitely say it’s going difficult without real consequences. consequences don’t “laws” either, deadlier pandemic would also wake people naturally get rid still sleeping it. bigger problem US economy pharmaceutical industry powerful actively manipulate basic human practices favor. would far cheaper far effective send two week supply MRE’s (meals ready eat) every man woman child US, along 2 weeks pay 2 week forgiveness loans told stay home 2 weeks followed heavily politicized route taken. short term, effective plan never plan, clearly. 12 yr old could hypothesized better plan enacted. pandemic I’ve regularly reminded quote late great mystic, George Carlin…”Think smart average person remember half dumber that!” 

Basic hygiene selflessness intellectual, altruistic impossible traits expect and/or implement society. society revolves around making money selfish desires illness, get got.  forget someone said it'll Easter Thanksgiving last year. Vietnam's minister health said too, way really beat virus vaccines. Nobody's arguing vaccines here. know vaccine solution social distancing always damage control measure. Nobody VN saying since social distancing well, need vaccines.

Vaccines evenly distributed around though, that's unfortunately world works. find incredibly offensive US gov give monetary incentives _beg_ citizens take shots, people elsewhere suffering would take vaccines heartbeat. Probably could go give century's share Vietnam Flashbacks! way worded first sentence makes sound like similar considerations also apply immunosuppressed think response valid. one understand basic science here? manufacturers “recommendation” quite simply fact trials tested one dosing gap know sure gap effective don’t know sure gaps effectively. manufacturer drawing expertise make informed judgement best dosing gap. It’s literally saying “we know works”. It’s absolutely right public health immunisation experts take sensible step extending gap vaccines use know extended gaps aren’t issue potential lives saved huge, it’s good evidence supported scientific judgement.

Plus real world evidence - far outweighs 15,000 vaccine recipients clinical trial - covering millions shows extended dosing gap actually increases efficacy. still go this? legend. even month ago, American redditor arguing Canadian culture close American culture remarked (Canada) nearly many anti-vaxxers (in share population course).

In Canadian provinces, ~90% 70+ got first dose already. Québec even higher with[ 87-92% 60+ received first keep going there's still % waiting first appointment.  concern greater that. life lifelong disabilities? access vaccines. got shipments AstraZeneca, use 75% fear blood clots.

It's tragic stupid brave mean fully rule engineering tho let's even get started absolute havoc mosquitos could cause warmer world. Probably people “just asking questions” lab leak actual racists trying shift blame US’s horrible responses scary Chinese Current evidence suggests Oxford AZ vaccine (the UK’s main non mRNA vaccine use moment) effective variant identified Pfizer vaccine found 88% effective stopping symptomatic disease Indian variant two weeks second dose, compared 93% effectiveness Kent variant.
The AstraZeneca jab 60% effective Indian variant, compared 66% Kent variant.

The numbers look lower AZ likely due fact measured sooner vaccination (ie comparable study Health England (PHE) said difference effectiveness vaccines two doses might explained fact rollout second doses AstraZeneca later Pfizer vaccine, approved first.
Other data shows takes longer reach maximum effectiveness AstraZeneca vaccine, PHE said.

What’s informative look relative Kent variant, show small relative reduction.

We good data Kent variant efficacy Pfizer Oxford AZ vaccine show high significantly different unvaccinated, vaccine effectiveness 1 dose estimated 54% (95% CI 50-58%) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 53% (95%CI 49-57%) Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Compared 4 13 days post vaccination, 57% (95%CI 53-61%) 58% (95%CI 54-62%) respectively.
After 2 doses, effectiveness estimated 90% (95%CI 82-95%) Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine 89% (95%CI 78-94%) Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine compared unvaccinated. Compared 4 13 days post vaccination, 91% (95%CI 83-95%) 90% (95%CI 80-95%) study doesn’t specifically filter Kent variant, it’s U.K. population, time study Kent variant dominant strain.

So don’t think use non mRNA vaccines contributor. Another simple illustration vast majority hospitalisations people without full course vaccination. tf extend expiry date? saw article blaming Africa's vaccine shortages India ""stopped exporting"" Like wtf countries even start exporting gets zero blame country gets blame stopping exports.

This observation based single article. don’t see entire world media punching India stopping exports. wonder Indians like West. guys hypocritical af. call us third world country get mad perform worse first world countries.

I’d reckon many Indians idiolize west wouldn’t give chance settle got one. 

The west doesn’t get mad India. They’re highlighting issues we’re facing now, sold media fails do. people USA dying like flies putting dead bodies freezers pictures doctors, nurses people working hard.

Ugh, untrue. clearly remember AajTak, RTV, Zee, ABP news constantly showing USA’s worsening condition fight covid. visuals cremating thousands dead bodies open grounds. 

US didn’t whine Indian media back then. India same? Pictures misery death suffering likely taken without permission. consider us human beings thoughts emotions.

So want do? Hide reality? Put rose tinted glasses, praise supreme leader, jerk nationalistic historic videos, go bed call day? 

Why can’t face truth? Indians dying streets due LACK O2, covid. People bribe, beg plead get bed hospital, close ones fell unconscious arms. 

This something west media made themselves. reality country openly rightfully displayed. think us zoo animals who's misery showcased world enjoy. That's hate world.

You care much image country yet don’t want anything bring actual tangible changes ground. 

A maniac PM spending billions new parliament amidst pandemic shameful. Rather someone take nobody. Hell, there's large majority people cross border meds sooo started administering Moderna recently. 

Problem supply anyways. track receive 120M Pfizer end June. dunno man. **do** care strangers choice matter is? long paying everything including vaccine, I'm okay this. getting free taxpayers' backs. emerged spill animal reservoir (almost certainly bats).

I'll take ""random ledditor pulls nonsense ass claims fact"" 500, Bill. It’s China’s fault certain political leaders didn’t take seriously Yep generally higher number social contacts making great vector. Идиоты said going waste. supply Michigan higher demand.  Woew, watched video, thanks letting know it. Good news concern tapering off. lack supplies anymore. literally walk in, get shot. Anecdotal, mid may shot, place already walk- ins, make appointment first jab. 

We're going see lot people getting vaccine anymore. anti maskers, anti vaccine, trumpters general keen it. 

It's also I'll still wearing mask foreseeable future. even though unmask vaccinated, trust folks. Covid vaccination government said last month would acquire 150 million jabs COVID-19 vaccination program, including directly purchased doses obtained via COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme.  shots part Vietnam's first batch 117,600 doses AstraZeneca vaccine arrived late last month.  government plans free vaccinations, front-line workers, security forces, diplomats, teachers people 65 older among first inoculated. Lol sit  We’re hitting sputter, without teens becoming eligible number would significantly lower. There's reason expect rise back kids become eligible. We’ve predicting final vaxx rate around 50-60% total pop. That’s natural immunity. So, it’s super surprising.  looked around neighborhood seen zero covid locales low vaccination rates Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan grapple new bigger outbreaks due new infectious variants think maybe get shots outbreaks hit HK too?

Those places choice vaccine supply limited. HK good supply, including going expire soon, yet sitting ass delaying. herd immunity need least 70 85% fully vaccinated. definitely numbers yet. singlehandedly took enormous effort public health apparatus, instrumental. course doesn’t happen guy office. think judiasm something religion patch update account safety benefits weird thing say.  Concerning, early. little less half population US land area size Iowa. figure entire US open least 4th July sooner. know countries, never claimed expert matters.   Good point far allergies contagious. didn’t even think aspect. 

For it’s worth, I’m vaccine. I’m personally less nervous covid vaccine side effects. 

Perhaps that’s narrow minded me, I’ve worked entire covid fiasco place minimum safety measures. feel like I’ve likely even noticed. 

No one I’ve talked who’s gotten symptoms beyond minor cold symptoms, however know fair amount people absolutely miserable day two vaccine. 

I realize isn’t everyone’s experience. I’m trying explain personally haven’t rushed get vaccine. Yeah I’m really mad this. demand vaccines decreasing US (since many science deniers) US piss poor sharing supply. 

I wish people didn’t go lengths get fucking shots! simple Google search math, takes 2 seconds, see true. 170m cases 3.53m deaths, mortality rate 2%, we're even counting people still need long term care due side effects covid  guess missed part said agreed best scientific thing could do.

Now best scientific thing person/country stop new much infectious covid get vaccinated. That's Vietnam's covid numbers going up. worked good enough now. occupational health dept verify one vaccines years ago, called check titers.  Pfizer prioritised countries current outbreaks, reduce deaths protect health systems. Since NZ cases placed low queue. signed contract countries, way back October 2020. Pfizer agree deliver doses large numbers July 2021. Peanuts compared making huge efforts waste 30M+ doses vaccinating people already survived Covid USA. enough vaccinate Canada's entire adult population. Maybe people need get boosters half dose bring immunity back later point we're 16+ months pandemic going worldwide serious illness reinfection remains rare. doses we've trying stick arms already immune much better places go. Google pg 6 Robert Kennedy jr!!!!!!!!!!! Go hole . know bad when..... anyone care? stay away people Alabama. grownups made decision. want get sick die choice. themselves. They’re putting kids, immunocompromised don’t respond well vaccines, cancer chemo patients risk.

And also us due increasing risk variants evade vaccines. Plus end paying thousands hospitalizations form higher taxes insurance premiums. article's title makes chlorine dioxide sound like exoteric poison....

To clear, chlorine dioxide consumer-grade disinfectant dangerous used correctly. less unpleasant effective bleach disinfecting. buy chlorine dioxide sports store.

Just like bleach, chlorine dioxide ""bad."" drink inhale 100% concentration. ""If escaped lab, might actually good news new measures could place avoid happening again"" lab CCP regime china. GOF standards meet one kept secret. Fauci careless. Let us fund lab Wuhan. KNEW something up-the CCP is-they lie them.This kind crap banned totally. intended nothing biological weapon. apologize it’s wrong, said let’s assume... sounds like listening Rob Reid? haven't, love (*epic*, 4-hour long) episode Making Sense podcast - argues strongly favour threat detection systems. Alabama pretty good cases/deaths. Maybe simply ahead curve. death rate? Vietnam open business travel foreigners. need test negative 21-say quarantine.

Wow that's real slow business travel lol. Children 2-11, possibly around September/early fall

under 2, possibly late CEO Pfizer said expect apply EAU 2-11 September keeps flip-flopping betweeen pretending nothing, pretending doesnt exist peddling fake cure thats unproven anywhere say ppl allowing enemies. Funny would post Reddit taking different street drugs could laced knows what... bash vaccine. Isn’t hypocritical? Even one variants certain countries let spread shocks kind thing isnt happening often even It’s businesses, it’s state government facilities. banned state-run I’m sure municipality run county-run buildings placing mask requirements. Private buildings included. thing happened Texas. I’m saying isn’t stupid, want accurate. correct say much worse could’ve people say denier something.   death rate nowhere near 2%. Stop misinformation. Erm. assume 18500 vaccinated people would definitely certainly get COVID. don't. every single person gotten infected. Anyone pressuring garbage. got vaccination, everyone risk able to. none business want take risk, business putting people risk.  discussion long take small children eligible? heard take longer need adjust dosage. Meh. rich country citizen going like truth. like they'll blame India pollution conveniently forgetting far, far, higher emissions per capita. Gl next batch illicit drugs. Betting labs decades vaccine research pure irony. fact likely catch dead take vaccine true statement point. I'd give guys. vaccination plateaued give unused ones another place demand it. Everything political. Perfect timing. recovered cold. Let’s go! said possible. said, I'm sure make assumptions here, scenarios also exist likewise possible, active PRC intervention absent. example, suppose BNT really dealing least two competing orders situation occurred Taiwan-deal side. Given Taiwan replied something short five minutes, possible time Taiwan-deal air, concurrent negotiations prompted BNT prioritise (part of) doses another deal.

Mainly I'm bothered fact BNT specifically *asked* Taiwan change, instead telling deal go ""global vaccine distribution timeline"" reasons. vaccinated much less much poorer countries like Bolivia, Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Cambodia, Moldova, etc? Pfizer hate them? Lol need detain anyone stop international travel. 

You stop citizens inform foreign countries (highly transmissible virus you’ve discovered) workout plans foreign citizens there. 

The Chinese government none this. point start shipping massive portions production countries actually *do* demand. gotta feel like we're pretty close. Imagine reading someone losing parents COVID think great recruiting tool would military, twat. Amen  China. One way another. fix: get rid CCP.  think missing point. I'm support unregulated market. group support that, group want vaccine lot overlap. probably watching cruise ships sailing past full tourists bulging wallets. Shit, also mandate health records decide wether hire based prior illness family history regarding disease hereditary traits? 
Will allow government mandate abortions fetuses deemed 100% healthy completely regulate pregnancies based prior family records illnesses hereditary issues child might born with.
Where exactly end? U grip deez nuts lot vaccine urgency NZ. vast majority population wants govt signing deals secure enough vaccinate whole populace four times since last year. low supply delivered Pfizer far reason low vaccination rate. big shipment arrives beginning July.  really all. Race can't controlled harmful society. definitely hit herd immunity yet enough drop significantly.  Go right ahead. vaccine meeeeeeeee “I’m canceled damn liberals...”  Yeah I've happy Bloomfield pandemic now, nuts. describes Level 2.5 4 level Covid Alert system. level 1 basically restrictions 95% time since last May. Level 2 couple weeks huge pressure get back Level 1. he's saying go 2.5 3-5 years vaccinate everyone? crazy. Well make explicitly clear anti vax anti mask restaurant. look discussion, lot people discussing anti vax component. Ridiculous comparison things person's control harm society whole, unlike refusing vaccine. Well point gotta move on! get though. Stop spreading fear individual fear. Unacceptable. Talk doctor. reddit.  Sitting bus seems fine. work 10 hour shifts feet manual work sun, it’s miserable Ah, edited original include ""prominently"" mention.

Why prominent matter? Get grip. need teenagers children herd immunity level. can’t wait small children eligible How’s Florida gonna deal that? Open borders Lol I'm advocating free market, I'm calling people advocate free market matter what, bit also refusing vaccine, lot overlap there. quit job end January. company nothing screen clients get tested (negative) quarantined full 10 days (with doctor’s note) penalized. even worked 10 days remotely. I’m sorry loss. read article? Bloomfield, charge NZ response, clearly says elimination never happen globally disease going endemic, including NZ open borders. 

NZ never said elimination possible forever, goal always temporary, could vaccinate population. That's goal elimination (which temporary state) never eradication, permanently getting rid virus. many flat uninterested product. Bolsonero: Covid I’m fine! I'm CNA active COVID cohort - still get 80% hospital COVID patients us. husband fully vaccinated. wear mask case picked something work. class pregnant woman can't get vaccine I'd hate point transmission. 

I also trust people find mask minor inconvenience compared COVID... That's point, read comment again. possible caused negative attention pointed direction, *and* fired unfair reasons. always, avoid ""if smell shit everywhere, check shoe"" meme I'd either gaslighting lecturing someone who's obviously bad headspace. None said even cause considered ""circumstantial evidence"". agree, Canada already bunch AZ vaccine set expire week. Health Canada given go ahead continue use date. said count**y** count**ry** Serum Institute India probably worlds largest vaccine manufacturer. mean India worlds largest vaccine manufacturer. Seriously?

You stated never said don’t wear masks 

I stated say don’t wear masks changed guidance issue. 

I laid said said so. 

So I’m sure you’re going think want argue. 
You believe whatever want there’s discussion, discuss.  Yes it’s confusing know protesting exactly. point vial doesn’t suddenly go ‘oh shit it’s June 2nd, time breakdown’. It’s either started process vaccine manufacturers done extensive testing see best safely store vaccines, that's found like Pfizer stored -80C -60C (-112F -76F), Moderna -25C -15C (-13F +5F)...

So also means tested see long vials safely stored process begins...   Blame government instead US government. tax money went that.

Then again, guys would first list give away free. Youre alright lads.

But still. failure government success story mine. Although bet reddit think couldn’t beat orange…she disliked most. Sorry lost move on. thankfully has. problem third estimated.

It's estimated irrelevant. Specially estimate relatively low margin error.

And measured values fully explain current level Rt, need look data get better grasp situation. Ok. I'm ready shot cures common cold now. waiting for? didn’t explain anything. According CDC, small amount waste acceptable get people front vaccinated, rather reschedule hoping they'll come back later. Source: community health nursing administrator. problem know marketing need segment populations best results. people want hear something one way others want hear another way. public health one message upset confuse segment population without doubt. money still either ups truck thst delivered bats flipping market, incinerator guy incinerating hot coals market Hilldog would great. #sad find incredibly offensive US gov give monetary incentives beg citizens take shots, people elsewhere suffering would take vaccines heartbeat.

Same here. many jobs military. everything front line busting doors etc. I'm personally fan working things instead everything handed you. Also nobody said military option, option. know right? revisionist history former administration covid ridiculous. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Have questions vaccines? Check bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* VAERS 4600 deaths vaccine already. According studies 1-10% gets reported VAERS. Please explain vaccine safe many reported deaths? figured head confirmed? 

I'm still owed 30 weeks unemployment backpay 2020 unemployment office keeps dicking around people's ""eligibility"". get paid ended ""repayment notices"" large portion paid last year. lot complete screw unemployment system giving people heart attacks get letter saying owe back $12k go convoluted system can't talk anyone make decisions hoping get cleared.

Unless unemployment cut dry, many people screwed unemployment can't seem adjust additional pandemic benefits like PUA.   illegal require experimental product Emergency Use Authorization, includes Covid vaccines tests. EEOC says employers mandate long compliance Americans Disabilities Act guidelines coercing employees get it. 9% employers said mandate. Maybe st trouble filling job vacancies. I’m thinking EEOC challenged legally this. would call tens thousands doses life saving vaccines small. Every single one doses save life. Probably save one life actually.

It tragedy one vaccines goes waste millions people around world begging chance them.  issue chart assumes unvaccinated people less immunity vaccinated people. Whereas someone could already covid vaccinated still scientific perspective fall right side image vaccinated category.   comments pertaining Trump often get modded sub. Wah wah victim, get it. Seems little wrong opinion. history group ostracizing another ever good guys? Yeah it’s balance. public health school taught make issue briefs 3-5th grade level. professor ran program part grade.

The issue works millions people, many people actually smart enough understand nuance people either socially ridiculed less less faith governing institutions. It’s lack education country wide level that’s causing us issues give advice 330 million people it’s almost impossible make blanket statement scientific accuracy. It’s public health paradox I’m seeing.  would great time people start giving restaurant poor reviews ;) failing account psychological effect supporters fact States looking guidance federal government, administration failed provide. continue wearing leave rest us vaccinated folks alone.

Let Darwin handle rest. Depends live. live Alabama New York completely different you...

J&amp;J recipients women. 

[That's earlier reports, one TTS patient male; now, six men among 28 patients. Theres going fourth wave regardless. Whether summrr Fall next year, happen.

The hope wave worse cold flu.  Even tattoo artists states required hepatitis vaccines else can’t work. shouldn’t even argument. nonsense. OWS $10 billion federal funding involved multiple federal agencies - CDC, DHHS, FDA, NIH others. Trump signed that. program payed development ordered hundreds millions doses vaccines. time Biden inaugurated, US's vaccine program well ahead developed nations. able hit ambitious targets work done previous administration. 

Trump obviously hindered vaccination public health efforts absolutely terrible leader pandemic, say US would state Brazil re-elected rewriting history disservice public servants made program success spite Trump's incompetence   still quite possible we'll find similar natural cause covid although behaviour Chinese government refusing access raw data suggests something else may gone on. Alabama slammer coming soon interesting many people say rights. reality government needs make mandatory, list things cannot places cannot go make practical skip vaccination. Like not, writing already wall... Free isn’t cheap enough guess. vaccines? use ""trust science"" like insult lol. Yeah trust science guilty charge. magical vaccine wand

Wow. magic all. science seem problem with. Well that's nothing new pandemic especially America. We'll wearing masks September least..nobody Oregon going let crap go new identity desk worker / cubicle, pretty much throughout entire pandemic working home, working home? top 8th state deaths. vial different? point vial doesn’t suddenly go ‘oh shit it’s June 2nd, time breakdown’. It’s either started process hasn’t, date label totally totally independent process. Sure many natural immunity actually covid herd immunity would natural immunity plus vaccinated immunity. months, nothing vaccine changed all…the data hasn’t changed. vaccine safe Available everyone right now. 

No, fully vaccinate it’s approved good luck you. rest us part. weakest parts society made known.

And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.”  

I don’t remember Fauci really hammering “masks make things worse “ bullshit guess little. CDC pushed based IDK remember really annoyed time since countries used masks already better outcomes. overall Fauci way good harm, even misstep. I’d prefer socialism thanks. need wear Gym Walmart prepare snarky comments random strangers. \*Sigh\* argument could possibly give vaccines, vials might different.

So far we're talking gain function research nearly enough. we've recently re-funded billion dollars Aye subscribe written.

I really doubt would design all, moreso state level. Let's say China, would gain killing well destabilising economies supply chains around planet, much exporter relies things.

If design 'unseen' high tier people say, population correction, really shite virus design sadly killed many, nowhere near level people 'required' type action.

At stage hope find came from, feel it'll end lots blaming sabre rattling really what's point that. I'd say take long hard look gain function research, consider banning instead pumping billions it. Maybe September I’ve heard.. Didn’t Canada pass US terms percentage population received first dose already? China natural immunity, would justification requiring vaccine? Look Bolton reasonable argument, noted 96% strong link.

The real origin 99% identical more. would probably take decades mutate 96% identical virus Sars-Cov2.

True think would, although would make covid 24 pandemic little less horrible multitude different strains popping virus mutating? India fucking nightmare here. Let go false positive news hear vaccination. 3% fully vaccinated vaccine less efficacy. reading articles (I sure true) vaccinating people middle pandemic 100% effective vaccines giving virus chance mutate become immune antibodies. vaccinated might experience non severe covid become carrier non vaccinated people coming lethal. 

I also came across video congressman/senator Dr Fauci debating claims made US funds ""gain function"" research Wuhan covid outbreak result it. know man humanity bold statement.

Not sure ommited /s, causality first second part comment escapes me.

Corona viruses particularly susceptible Free Speech anti-viral agent, think. would someone recovered covid need vaccine? need start vaccine lottery every state drive numbers quicker. people go back country (in case Thailand) enter state quarantine 14 days. mean enter state quarantine US It’s choice forced duress. losing ones job.

Well, USA didnt disappear anyone. Although throw least one person jail leaking.

O, well particularly. huge amount viruses exposed really bad also old ones frozen ones already never seen could turn bad too.

That's works. Even assume 5% death rate anyone getting covid, every single person without vaccine gets covid, single dose would save, most, .05 people. think areas better others. areas better initially, sone areas better later on.

The USA Europe hard compare actually. december Europe seemed better, third wave kinda ruined that.

So kinda equivalent maybe. Europe USA could done better several instances, without doubt. vaccinated person. care health safety people unable get vaccinated — children, adults medical and/or logistical obstacles. people danger anti-vaxxers too. Pfizer thing. comment Democrats response would bad well. used slippery slope fallacy pretend response New York indicates country would respond constitutional rights would trampled. outside perspective, look like much locked UK. sure protesting point. need research produce vaccines building models. Unless know magical way guarantee terrorist group rouge state never able future.

Also natural jump research may made easier develop tests, finding effective drugs predict spread. George W. Bush foresight understand pandemic possibility. wasn’t exactly favorite president, credit it’s due, gather experts researchers made pandemic plan almost two decades really needed it, good one. Obama administration went Bush Pandemic Plan H1N1 outbreak 2009. worked. I’m baffled Trump admin decided use Bush plan.  armed services don’t provide option military members. Get vaccinated dishonorable discharged. It’s difficult approved case. FDA needs get moving full approval remove arguments people know Covid-19 also comes bat's? comparing things required emulate Australia.. country similar US lockdowns worked. harsh measures imposed *nothing* effect. 

14 days quarantine states outbreak total lockdown 4 months one particular state thing worked. drawing long bow - exactly happened. largely still place today (7 day lockdown right one state). anti-lockdown protest resulted shopping centre locked down? Legally, thing hang hat emergency authorization. Similar thing happening armed forces. 

My daughter's nurse forever arguing nurses take vaccine. One compelling arguments doctors falling get it. understand vaccinated people care unvaxxed people wear mask not. chosen get vaccinated, chosen risk covid infection, that's it. Following science point? always point. enough vaccinated naturally immune/recovered people reopen. 

It's going take time get ideas this, COVID U.S. like bad flu season. Science never us masked those. don’t change present view clearly. Would leader said virus dangerous advised Americans wear masks social distance saved lives? Would leader promoted science saved lives? Would leader encouraged everyone get vaccine made related safety information public saved lives? top that, photos coming USA europe misery 99% non white Okay you’re spreading fear without facts. vaccine prevents symptoms 99% time. made dude. live life said, talks important masks people infected healthcare professionals, overuse masks could lead mask shortage. short clip, watch it, insane said clear film yet twisted much. wasnt yes, pepple actually listening so. literally say that. Lol It’s over...

...Because people taking vaccines. 

And we’re nowhere near herd immunity wouldn’t anything dozen cases odd flare up. still need huge number people take vaccines.  anti-lockdown outside open shopping center? caveat ""if said property open public"", extension language tied private property. gist private property used public said protections apply. 

Doesn't change anything. farmer fields still can't arrested operating equipment drunk since fields open public. rancher driving private roads. US public schools require certain vaccines enter certain grades, know get tetanus vacc freshman year high school. ""blame free"" exactly? sounds like actual blame.... somewhere, something somebody fault... 

Just pretend national image politics exist? something similar Netherlands, indoors outdoors. people didn’t wear masks, get tested two days advance 5 days event. results quite positive. Holy shit right. There's clear difference. alarming amount people spreading “covid vaccine reduces symptoms, doesn’t reduce spread” narrative. I’m surprised people aren’t bothering get it, especially people already covid wasn’t bad them. That’s lot speculation wonderful story you’ve spun based response single hard hit state. Actually according article say wear masks. month later said wear them, guidance changed. understand point save N95’s health care workers, said that. 

I recall early recommended masks said bandanas, cotton cloth coverings, etc good enough, lots crafters started making selling masks. 
(Anyone else remember that?)

That would better way present issue - save N95, wear something. 

Instead got yes. 

( didn’t leave house basically two announcements, ordered regular surgical masks early prepared could get crafted cloth masks) rate waste, pharmacy gets 500 doses day would 1 2 left over. trying say pharmacy Kalamazoo one dose left 7 pm drive 4 hours Canadian border administer every single day? 

It like big pile vaccines Ren Cen Detroit every day load truck put tunnel, spread throughout state.  Current rhetoric largely told Covid over, don’t see point near-guaranteed sick day vaccination late pandemic risk covid infection minuscule (..it’s not, see masks almost nowhere anymore South). yeah, aware employer shitty working class Americans don’t many options. They’re making options they’re aware of, understanding risks told they’ll fare worse get shots. probably explain away convince individual, address macro scale millions unvaxxed working class? Yeah, think that's flexible approach best. There's room lots people find path suits employer best, think. still manage capture dicknose article's picture.  thanks.. Supporting business believe science doing.. Let go bankrupt. use vaccine developed amazing healthcare system. would need anything us dumb ass americans? think uber offer expires end May unfortunately think too. That’s everyone gets one cold entire life! Get early way! That's point... point antimaskers going going covid going spread international agreement also applied USA!

Believe worldwide ""lifestyle"".  countries continents patterns human growth expansion. 

How prepare know risks are?  treat everyone bad flu novel virus? feasible, can't prepare every possible eventuality, treat every sick person though patient zero pandemic synch reality. 

So reality? virus emerge?  hell prepare another pandemic, know started first place? People scared might warfare. people think mistake. know America full lockdown weeks months India didn’t. That’s irrefutable fact. Maybe PM Modi concerned Indians wouldn’t exported 50% vaccines meant Indian citizens protection? Probably, clear long immunity lasts infection, likely immunity vaccine lasts longer.

And ""Seasonal human coronavirus antibodies boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection associated protection""

And ""Our findings suggest prior infection seasonal coronavirus provide immunity subsequent infection SARS-CoV-2."" self-interested corruption? Fixed! - hoops simple, policy stated company hand book, zero hoops jump
 - typical warning caution dismissal valid almost cases fire one state It’s great see. Ah yes, US vaccinated like half people world declare covid since know country *really* exists. flu really nasty. folk call ""flu""...actually really flu.  memorial day approaching people running around without mask may may vaccinated. would like pay coworker mine died covid.

On day 1 hearing mysterious covid thing took pre-cautions immediately masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, etc. People made fun overreacting 
- people come calling paranoid freak husband firefighter told masks useless thus mask useless

Early stages covid/reopening took social distancing carefully point stand distance sometimes around corner needs to. Even helping customer point people demanded fire social distancing 

One one coworkers around us starting catching covid, took give everyone friendly reminder going cdc guidelines, social distancing, sanitation, etc.

About month everyone could vaccinated got covid passed away could vaccinated.

Nearly, 600k americans died. Sadly one them. Never got chance become nurse, got close vaccinated, never got see end. never thought I’d say Doug Ford really looking good right now

Don't say that. terribly sorry bad things Manitoba right now, Ontario despite Doug Ford, him. honestly could exact place, nurses two years treated like shit instead four, quite end rope yet. 

Ford badly pissed ends political spectrum. people want reasoned science based approach can't stand fact making every decision last possible second, often seat pants. Meanwhile people want open completely mad latest random decision seems overly conservative compared places gone ""Leeroy Jenkins"" strategy. things here:.  

1. said 6 others, so, SEVEN.. 3.   

2. I'm vaccines. Infact I'm them. I'm completely flu shots, protect exact strain &amp; pumping useless crap body. Covid shot lasts 3-7 months, depending boosters, body, etc... Covid flu &amp; mutates, thus getting shot it, garbage. single-strain disease like mumps rubella, would definitely get shot. Additionally, even 3 shots &amp; one ""booster"" ""immune"" MAYBE 8-13 months &amp; need next year, like normal bullshit flu shots.  

The last time flu shot 20 years ago &amp; last time flu right got shot. slander will, I'm getting vaccine something mutates faster even keep records of... WV Supreme Court, US Supreme Court. conflict law would need settled. that's somewhat true, fire someone without jumping correct hoops paying unemployment long time. 

There exceptions, stealing, assault etc. Even drug use protected pretty crazy. Propagation mutant strains, perhaps? Two isolated communities could develop strain. they're introduced new population, shit could hit fan.



Say Quebecois, invade beaches summer, came contact Florida Man, brought back Montreal? mullets everywhere!



In seriousness, lament able visit; one province left! Newfoundland &amp; Labrador bust! anti-citizens.  doesn’t matter want fight it. It’s easier actual thinking person.  Newsflash: covid virus world. we've seen powerful masks are, I'm taking mine airport. Herd immunity here.

Spring here. say (and defense, important aside understanding American response) major forces made worse would still present president.

1. CDC still would muddied waters early masks, think would even harder candidate 2016 convince anti-mask crowd anything.

2. would still enormous pressure businesses keep economy open reopen quickly trade lives profit. think biggest driving factor lackluster lockdown.

3. science still would taken year find warmer climates fair better (outdoors makes transmission incredibly difficult) US super varied climate. Smaller countries closer poles (like Sweden) quickly found lockdowns effective direct effect curve, warmer US states different colder states, muddying waters response provoking scientifically illiterate (not understanding iterative process science).

4. lack nationalized even public healthcare system. national health organs (CDC, NIH, etc) direct, state health departments enforce, federal system means even hospitals complete plan place new guidance slow roll out.

5. Hell, I'd even argue president would less constrained say false things virus, running rallies shtick last year.

I think major thing would changed would quicker use DPA manufacture PPE mission essential equipment healthcare workers. Vaccination way end pandemic. think countries containing virus well, unlike Alabama rest US, locking racing vaccination? don’t understand people think pandemic variants racing Asia South Asia Europe crawling lockdowns use vaccines. Edit add: South America underreported highest cases deaths happening right now.

It’s Alabama get citizens residents vaccinated. fallacy pandemic doesn’t help. end getting fever hours second time, nothing else. Like literally nothing else chills headache sores etc like usually get ill fever. Still beats getting covid! know viruses mutate jump animals humans. surprise. CNN really stupidest right now.  yeah. listening TWIV obvious open mind different possibilities.  truth know came from

...he also dismissed idea UK Kent variant transmissible. Wrong.  course! it. Frankly, understand people feel like attacked decision remain unvaccinated. individual actions affect public health situation, including individuals can't get vaccinated, healthcare system overwhelmed covid cases before, etc PLUS vaccines 100% effective. saw old acquaintance post facebook personal decision get vaccine make bad person. mean, disagree seems selfish, unless can't get vaccine whatever reason (availability, allergies, etc.) agree disagree, fact unvaccinated people putting everyone risk believe selfish. That’s deleted comments lol enough medical knowledge make definitive judgment here. guess call. lot people would okay masks/distancing circumstances, depends risk tolerance comfort levels. Worst hit metric? live NJ. lead country deaths adjusted population last checked cases adjusted per population Florida Texas. strictest mandates country. I’m claiming COVID over. part, played rules, got vaccinated. zero covid US realistic. It’s year, point people need live lives. studies indicate vaccinated risk extremely low. could replace ""vaccination"" ""wear pants"". things apply wearing pants well. There's countless social mores make less sense participating combating pandemic complaining offenses liberty politicized.  We’re also bad calculating risk. first half pandemic, people left devices experiences. “It can’t bad” says people who’ve never lived pandemic before.

I one found stressful thing working best courses action family. can’t get people come coherent world view, I’ve tried.... We're lockdown cases starting go down. Lockdown also ended first second waves. excuse continue authoritative measures point. vaccines work they? obviously do, afraid Canada? 20% full vaccination Canada within 5 weeks. 600 members parliament?

I surprised guess. Texas right work state. Employers fire employees reason. Except would gone bad anyway time got here. vial contains multiple doses, lost doses partially used vials. bad OP wrong writing way. brief second, thought young Randy Quaid. “the” standard, “a” standard. imagine “standards” now. mine supreme court...4 years ago conviction upheld asked for. case 1980. enough scrambling. I'm done. They’re thinking logically. matter cut it, 37k vaccines wasted 10 million massive success. Imagine we’d done ASAP passed monthly checks everyone could locked thoroughly reopened schools. 

IDK many lives would saved I’m confident would saved some. Believe worldwide ""lifestyle"". countries continents patterns human growth expansion.

With rare exceptions every developing nation walks similar path: expansion, industrialization, resource overconsumption, population, expansion maybe shift green energy late stage. I'm saying law human nature know. Given chance stability, thats prepare know risks are? 

You try catch patient zero.


We know risks are. main concern pathogen manages human-to-human transmission. prepare that. prepared lockdown, prepared emergency quarantine response, prepared maximum number people work home. budget support that. Fund initiatives home learning. Stockpile PPE increase ICU capacity. Aside that, likely respiratory pathogen. So, mask stocks more


 could zoonotic, could interplanetary. may parasitic, could fucking prion. matter. trolling well played. don’t know tell you. Keep wearing mask car driving around alone suppose.   Vaccines last longer 6 months.  requires thinking, foreign exercise politicians First one going (hopefully) recommend take untested mix vaccines. could fine, could not, knows. don’t info boosters yet even they’re needed. Don’t seek medical advice Reddit unless you’re truly options. 

I’m sure vaccine have, research mRNA ones last LEAST 6 months. That’s widely distributed long first data saying lasts long. said last least 3 months on. 

We don’t know long last yet haven’t long enough. know still effective 6 months though. News outlets done public disservice reporting way makes people think vaccines kaput 6 months in.  Yeah, strong travel pauses, lockdown, quarantines, tracing, testing (it done clinics, wtf) mask/essentials/distancing adherence. Also able shift remote learning work without much friction.

But hey, let's hedge whether someone came contact diseased animal whether inside lab, meat plant, hunting. personal responsibility preparation. I'd keep masks wear sick need go get medicine food whatnot. think still useful hand  I'm sure climate change this. pandemics industrial era know?

Alright then. care unvaccinated people infecting children 12 people can't get vaccine health reasons. That's it. true. I've hearing lately struggle get people second dose Canada. Worse, people aeen't getting recommended month first.

I might already partially vaccinated, catching mild case covid. either that, hyper flu symptoms covid. someone worked home since start pandemic, can't even imagine wear mask full-time job. shudder thought going back grocery store job...but wearing mask day.

Vaccers like relish lost opportunities ;) Name one non extreme. wear mine hours day work overtime. Speak yourself. 200 different strains viruses several different virus types (Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, Coronavirus RSV), going tough make vaccine everything. said, feel like mRNA gives us improved chance least increasing immune response towards those. EU testing capacity terrible. positivity rates much higher. it’s “no worse flu” we’re seeing Israel barely even present, I’m sure considering “fourth wave” started late finally making right choices: authorizing non-doctors shots letting local governments fill missed appointments low priority people.  wear mask everywhere California too. city cancelled Fourth July parade even though high vaccination rate. I’m staring get sick too, fully complied since beginning. believe another part equation US always hear pandemics countries part, US personally affect them. kind figured COVID would like SARS, Zika, Ebola, etc. non-issue US.   entire comment thread started talking private businesses checking vaccination records.

So yes, missing fucking context.

Next time read, please. EU close US UK vaccinations. July according projections: France etc full rabid anti vaxxers. least 6 months likely longer.  Needing hearing aids long COVID tough. That’s got one worst longterm symptoms I’ve heard about.   wrong actually, flu considerably lethal young adults. viruses transmissibility + exponentially greater mortality rate amongst older adults makes problematic  Still better turning society authoritarian,surveillance,collectivist dystopia hit gulag stick like nail. Maybe im stupid, read article basically saying term airborne needs redefining confusing language used before. general population thinking something stays air ( thoughts ) fact travel certain distance. 

If something airborne tend think virus floating around air inhale time cross someone. article seems explain mentioned biggest risk droplets traveling distances covering surfaces touch. that's airborne virus travel air. confusing language. see says droplets suspended air long period time. point masks stuff cough mask air gets pushed sides. Especially medical masks see everyone wearing. true. point people’s hand washing habits lost noise compared prevention measures. Businesses checking vaccination status. can't even imagine retail/restaurant/etc. worker that. remember working grocery store simply checking credit card signatures card oooof, stopped quickly due upset customers. Can't imagine vaccination checks would go Understand point, little kids can't yet get vaccinated even parents desperate it.

Seems like opening borders would make lot sense then. increase vaccinations, since US dangerous anymore.  certainly didn’t know it, idea.

People tend really *really* binary thinking things. everything mentality inhabitants almost narcissistic arrogance recklessness citizens here

You draw East versus West comparison, except NZ/Australia show accurate. comes leadership setting standard enforcement rather national culture.  Canada half-vaccinating population (the thinking better everyone somewhat protected half population fully protected), effective newer variants. Second shots come much later, that's many trying cross border US get vaccinated. True. Another problem expense graduate school licensing, jobs pay well, financially entering mental health profession good investment people. people know stay field long term spouses earn better living help support them. canadians tried taking jabs americans wherever possible. thing since covid. pretty unreal experiences professionally early days getting rocked things flipped sudden silence. ""If believe one man could cause much chaos deluded. Hillary would have."" “Third wave, yes. fourth wave?” - Brian Pallister  way get immune systems fighting virus it’s variants year year. 

You going get thing, inevitable. 

It’s make risk calculation fight without help vaccine. personal choice. It’s easy, every hundred years last hundred years, pandemic broke out. know century passes, another way fully vaccinated people quarantine entering Canada archaic.

So, actually know archaic means.  police action get behind mean they've done bang job far revel ignorance. sure thats picture taken Mensa meeting? LOL Second doses roughly 12 weeks. mom got notification 12 weeks first dose looking shipment projections getting mine mid July would 12 weeks first dose.

I 100% agree shot go waste. Theres whole world people waiting vaccines. bats sars 2? Well start China ban study ultra contagious research viruses BSL-2 level labs (light PPE).

Lab leak not, reckless hell matter time leak happened/happens.  saying anyone this, wonder someone monstrous allergies take allergy meds decided visit hacking mucousy mess. think would issue person coughing hawking wads goo long wore shirt proclaiming covid vaccines hoaxes? gone pandemic excuse act way people question have. tiny bit critical thinking would enough start taking seriously much earlier, all. Even evidence stared face year, people still act like joke. that's perfect example insanely explicit human stupidity/arrogance/recklessness/egocentrism, etc. know is. explained US leading. fact is, given single argument AREN'T. So, I'm going explain again. go back read comment again, I'm extrapolating LEAST come argument ""NO even was, isn't, would terms fixing problem gotten big first place. like congratulating someone gained ton weight losing 100 pounds, everyone else stayed slim.

Again, subject discussion current effectiveness covid countermeasures, trying muddy waters bringing pandemic began individual countries treated months ago completely irrelevant bordering intellectual dishonesty.

Furthermore, think would find GREATLY minority believing wrong congratulate person losing 100 pounds. That's massive accomplishment takes staggering willpower. terrible analogy that, opinion, completely dismantles argument highlights abnormal potentially concerning actually comparing USA India? That's problem USA. always find worst case places compare to, think they're great. comparing best while?

Absolutely, am. said US would probably one last countries WORLD eradicate it, compare countries world currently worst go it? Would omit countries worse US becomes worst world fit worldview?

Yet again, US leading world currently comes battling covid. leading past? No. leading future? We'll see. keep trying gloss last year half one singular time changes safely say ""US BAD"", simple. Ignoring major advancements US made since January laughable deaths USA, money wasted, countries like Taiwan New Zealand took care things beginning, pretty well, nowhere even near catastrophic USA?

Yep, already covered. Completely irrelevant US currently handling pandemic. Best past? No. Best now? Arguably, up, kid.

Interesting see decided become uncivil. that?    needed, said, pathways young people color become licensed certified mental health providers without accumulating massive debt.

Yes. hear, men general needed mental health professions. would consider switching careers something useful like this, can't afford take student debt. (I've gotta eat pay rent, turns out.)

Education US expensive ramifications far beyond things typically discussed. -- emerging mental health crisis among teens -- latest. Honestly, think Covid going fond memory next pandemic. could 50 100 years now, eventually, kind super bug spread way society we'll able look covid see do. one time thing. That's gut feeling though. 1. Trust people study approve vaccines, unless work one companies FDA/CDC know enough make decisions yourself

2. ask medical advice random people internet, talk doctor concerned

3. timeframe yet think vaccine immunity wanes seen wane yet timeframe since first people gotten vaccine.

4. risk sounding mean concerned virus still vaccination willing turn experiment advice medical personnel may want think evaluating anxieties talking someone. Exactly, type shit conspiracy people afraid off. people don’t want get vaccinated, that’s problem. virus tell tale signs made lab. However modern methods virus development leave signs anyway. changed answer dude. That’s dishonest conversation. negative effects taking additional shot different manufacturer?

Wait 90 days courses fine. discussed multiple times TWiV. got pfizer days ago (never got covid know of). Everything fine, except sore arm like 24 hours Compared Sweden basically air conditioning all, definitely houses. Everyone looking forward warmth year get outside  1st shot, sore arm. 2nd shot, minor fever tiredness. happy take sick day relax/nap/listen podcasts. 2nd shot actually caused arm less sore compared first. Thanks replying. Would mix match option? I.e original moderna get j&amp;j booster? fired wearing socks annoying liking game thrones... reason all.

To fair, liked season 8 probably deserve fired. bootstraps tell em Paywall 0.3% waste btw
Ey yall want expired vaccine doses come trash men like  condom matter Yeah exactly. Wow, baseball game. stadium? covid, side effects mild. Maybe little headache, maybe little achiness, ""the blahs"", nausea anything like that. beers fine. Apparently supposed drink though. 

The first shot tends worse second covid. said, side effects sometimes absent shots, regardless previous infection. range absolutely nothing feeling really sick predicting gets side effects basically impossible.

The vast majority side effects mild. complaints side effects vastly represented threads like one people generally report absence symptoms (unless worried might working). No, population given generic N95 masks civil guard start pandemic go police station ask some.
They shitshow US PPE. Doublethink action.  going get thing, inevitable. 

Remember got smallpox? No. 
Because parents, generation, idiots. unethical?
People choice get shot turn it’s   Prove it, then. I've provided proof Canadians good neighbours, eh. Provide proof Canadians America's enemies. Sucks American.. you’re still wearing mask that’s fine. let’s yell random people street wearing mask. ball game outdoor mask mandate dude yelled SIL kids weren’t wearing mask. That’s super cool nothing. know multiple family members harassed wearing mask despite mandated anymore. never got covid reaction might different first shot moderna literally reaction sore arm bit. Second shot hit 12 hours injection lasted day. Fever, chills, fatigue. would prepare commission following day shot, opt Pfizer moderna. Yeah  Yeah, population-level plateau... Percentage-wise, US fully vaccinated people - Canada people 1 shot, means Canada way enthusiastic getting vaccines. could get 2nd shots, would great lol  don’t know lawsuit going achieve. one forced get “experimental medical treatment” one forced work there. 

You fired wearing socks annoying liking game thrones... reason all. SWEAR GOD, TAKE CANADA MYSELF. dammit, want someone else make rich :) probably will. least lobby make happen. would stupid try make compulsory really.  really 90%? mean... f--king awesome thought lower difficult urban areas comparable due employee patterns movement, types jobs, whether workers exempt lockdowns, multi-family/multi-generational living conditions.

Efficacy*** Hypothetically, escape accidentally. Thats concern. Shows lengths people go to.

Not even 'hurr durr China bad'. 100% efficiency looks like. spouse dependent

Also estate utilized pay medical bills (this would impact children receiving inheritance, property) felt fine people know(90% family gotten it). Nobody take day work, people headache felt groggy. I’m sure you’re skeptical getting vaccine right thing protect family. Don’t work hospital don’t want get vaccinated.  think suit going back fire give cover employers court decided fact require employees vaccinated highly doubt considering first infections started. going intentionally leak it, it'd better foreign country. 

It'd dumb leak country lab personnel.  people Covid longer immune. want one deny vaccination? Indeed, banning camping stupid ineffective. stick viruses weaponized. switch every second reply impossible I’m specifically pointing weaponizing research, virus research.

Are accusing CDC weaponizing ebola? I’m one skeptics US hasn’t gotten vaccine yet wife also skeptic. young child. new job may require travel, scattered reports Covid impacting kids, tons people around vaccine fine making consider getting vaccinated days.

In Western countries, average elected politician decade older average citizen, large portion citizens significantly older vast majority politicians. Parliamentarians/congressmen etc usually much fatter average person West, even thinner cases.

In lot African countries, average age politician seems three four times higher average citizen (in fact, average citizen even old enough vote lot countries). obesity levels much higher too. That's easy see looking photos parliamentarians.

There could bad death toll amongst elderly sections many African populations, death toll countries would still low compared developed world simply virtue small elderly population is. example, DR Congo (the country mentioned here, 2.5% 65. country like inevitably going *much* lower death toll, even poorer health care.

btw, Iran high death toll among politicians around February/March. course, Iran older demographics sub-Saharan African countries.

If mask summer vacation people woefully uninformed effective shots are, going really ticked off. group study came said research taken context media. HAHA, pathetic subreddit. true purpose Reddit always make fun Americans! i'm zero-waste recycle compost. eaten many old sneakers past year. suppose fair side effects extend day two most. long provide time they'll compliant that. 

No appreciable long term side effects currently known vaccine (apart preventing covid) entirely likely going change. So, suspect business cares enough require COVID vaccinations care near zero risk like this.  Link? actual news agency? 

The JJ shot placed hold 7 people 7 million developed clot. 7!!!

Please shot link misinformation. scientist worth shit tell that. Twitter trying hard silence people should. lie could bad Chinese people Chinese Americans.   1. chances spreading virus post-vaccination incredibly low. Unvaxxed Unvaxxed transmission major threat now.

2. gives bleep people think masking you’re fully vaccinated? could care less. Nobody operating true facts anymore. People either greatly underestimate effectiveness vaccine outright refuse take it. society’s lost damn mind. Yup evidence points completely natural lab leak kind. It’s excuse people hate China. isn’t even fair China improved lives people country. top among best prepared pandemic.   Correct. also celebrating obesity. *their* problem? They're working daily basis people whose health *already* compromised. something something freedom liberty something something, right? DC, vaccinated people wear masks. I'm going gym,.ball games, shopping, eating without mask. case are? necessarily. 56% Quebec least one shot number going keep rising time goes on. getting zero covid cases might possible possible prevent fourth wave. EU. J&amp;J probably meet commitment delivering 55M doses EU end June. even bitter US started using J&amp;J European production... states, simply lifted restrictions fully vaccinated people, let people make decisions best them. vaccine passport element, people trust one another believe effectiveness vaccines. 

In essence, vaccine readily available, everyone wanted get opportunity so, it’s time ease restrictions. government shouldn’t completely control people. people don’t want get vaccinated, that’s them. It’s another thing people want vaccinated, haven’t opportunity so, course. government doesn’t need to, honestly shouldn’t spinning it’s wheels figuring going enforce something, majority citizens evil. 

I think CDC right; fully vaccinated people less restrictions. unvaccinated people act like vaccinated people, putting risk. doubt, people frustrating spreading Covid increases chance mutating. point remains Canada much jurisdiction individuals. 

Canada’s healthcare system frustrating. build herd immunity within smaller community though. 

If 80% staff hospital vaccinated outbreak extremely unlikely spread around staff decimate workforce’s/spread patients staff go one another Funny, thought exactly thing wrote. 

I would never rude write down, are.  attitude, reality. America world's biggest pandemic. far country created misery destruction world last decades. ""high blood sugar"" Certain people unable take vaccine may still require hospital treatment.

Hospital policy protect cannot protected honestly don’t believe vaccinations shouldn’t working healthcare industry anyway. heard BioNTech Pfizer released statements booster 12 months small anxiety attack. I’m trial 12 month mark end July, concerned? course answer no, right vaccine covers known variants really it’s matter time one evolve skirt protection. nice woman doubt got phone calls us said, least right now, nothing indicate we’d given booster 12 month testing appointments (and don’t go get third shot apparently done). Though caveat regulators decide give us boosters timeline would extremely quick. yeah, we? Probably, now.  I'm NYC. still wear mask stores employees are. feels polite take little effort pop one order coffee. also eat restaurants without mask. usually go local places know staff know got vaxed months ago. also ask would like wear mask ordering. say no, got vaxed March/April. wear mask walking around outside. wrist. 

I'm basically safer COVID I've ever respiratory illness. still bring mask around pop dont find inconvenience might make someone feel little comfortable. philosophy not? political statement- statement community.  EU lot better South Korea. According Bloomberg South Korea administered enough vaccines cover 5% population EU countries somewhere 20-30% range.  ehhh may reporting issue. deep south days numbers barely moved all, next week dump once. happened alabama, example. days ridiculously low amount new cases, low california, next week case numbers jumped back ""normal"" levels. saw similar thing happen mississippis vaccine numbers. stuck % days ""jumped"" like half percent actually reported numbers Given many counties Coroners elected officials, counts certainty.  required medical even educational requirements.

Propublica investigation find strong correlation counties voted trump significant counts. Though likely political reasons, like tourism dollars, reliance service industry tax base, etc played reduced affixation Covid-19 cause death. 

note: Things like increased dose deaths, factor excess mortality though caused covid-19 increase occurrence likely impact Pandemic. considered part count analysis, may studies look excess mortality. count analysis stripped out. easy differentiate out. it’s first holiday cdc said vaccinated safe wearing masks.   SIL kids

kids 12?  Lots countries administering vaccines. According Bloomberg 1.85 billion shots given bit 0.3 billion given US. amount shots US administered certainly significant vast majority vaccines administered US. “The serious side effect” like dying Covid? spreading Covid? Ya bad! 

200 million doses given far country, serious side effects falling for. conspiracy spinning least current variants concern, current vaccines appear offer good protection serious disease.

There's finite manufacturing capacity mRNA vaccines, capital intensive expand.

There's moral question seen discussed yet: finite vaccine manufacturing capacity used either give boosters rich world, offer first doses nations developing world domestic vaccine manufacturing. clearly, later course greater potential save lives restore economic activity.

Once anyone wants vaccine access wealthy nations, perhaps defer  boosters uncontrolled outbreaks elsewhere. moral calculus could change variant arises evades immunity prior infection vaccination, that's situation present.

The states getting vaccinated. Considering Alabama 49th/50 vaccination impossible anyone Mississippi worse. yes, course rules apply. 

Get vaccinated snd don’t pretend pandemic ended. shit, Tam. Welcome 3 weeks ago. need headline. I'm way, fucking love rarely listen home, never miss show they're fun live?

Even pessimistic views put early next year, optimistic views say next several months. Pfizer already started filing paperwork question quickly FDA start review approve it. get Gucci vaccines. truly, sincerely hope 'Surging' needs put perspective. mostly one area far, Bolton, bulk cases young people eligible vaccine yet. UK still opened ages Bloody hell - spent 5 weeks hospital couple years ago  amount entitlement self-centeredness post absolutely absurd associate penalty blame show patience. That's create blame free environment K, see downplaying I've really tried find highly transmissible via aerosol airborne.

But suppose assumption China knew that? Like, ya point figured virus spreads, surprised China know period time. Like takes time figure things that's reality? surprised flu shot also comes fireworks streamers. Pretty sure telling responsibility go fix problems It’s side effect, you’ve got type illness. It’s basically like getting flu day half. Body aches fever. Take gummies sleep it. Good thing children 12 negligible risk developing severe cases covid. seasonal flu dangerous children covid, never masked seasonal flu. (U.K.) exciting days start kid’s medical training realised missed letter asking dates vaccinations turning filing cabinet inside looking 20 year old pieces paper. Seems odd use 'adults' metric though available 12+ well. 70% eligible would lot reasonable metric shoot for. vaccines already mandatory healthcare - e.g. hepatitis B vaccine mandatory surgeons least (likely staff). don’t see would different Canada lol funny ethics human experiments made sure absolutely one gets covid. results come and... surprise, surprise, one got covid. 😁   Every hospital I’ve worked requires vaccines proof immunity for: Hep-B, MMR, Diptheria, Varicella…and annual flu shots. case, mean come you’re Canadian you’ll fine. Worry third world countries got screwed Canada, US, UK, basically every first world country. Every rich country chance help countries really needed help instead chose help give scraps poor countries. reality every single rich country screwed actually need help, wasn’t America, really need help aren’t Canadian.  don’t tip then. Canada doesn’t want let us in.....?? Failure get vaccinated could seen placing fellow service men women harms way, creates unsafe condition threatens unit readiness. Hence service men vaccinated basic. Don’t want vaccinated, go home. It’s simple. go far…sadly not. 

Should they( approved) absolutely. might wrong industry. young person? curious since said never got nurse.  Tourism without quarantine likely won’t return 2022 earliest majority population vaccinated. big difference countries like US vaccinate asap restrictions deaths they’ve had, whereas Vietnam one seems rush. Ah that's fair employer requires mandatory Covid test daily unless provide proof vaccination.
Has worked convincing large number people get vaccinated work retail, food service, business exposes 50 people throughout 4-hour period time, required either get vaccinated wear mask get it/the pandemic status classified ""over"". Oh blankets small pox? You’re getting downvoted CDC recommend mask wearing vaccinated people except locations like airplanes hospitals I'm support every action India Modi blindly. wouldn’t say I’ve missing Bob. still sketchy whether university request vaccinations can, one two exceptions. Private businesses immunity liability universities U.S. do. keeping mask also especially i'm going crowded places.. No, type 2 diabetes clearly related diet. Us diet awful. Compare countries food companies make crap way less regulation. visit McDonald’s France food way better quality, less processed.

Wait, answer another thread… contagious present companies good employees heart… that’s it, want conformity. That's 8 hour shift workers… before taxes. slept whole next day first one. second one bad. 

I see probably majority US workers civilized employers though.  ability continually spread disinformation Canada impressive. strong, early response critical keeping outbreak occurring. China's numbers low take aggressive action early on. Exponential growth looks slow sudden, fast lost control situtation. Keep unvaccinated deck, hit 12 miles start enforcing vaccine passports - tell either get J&amp;J vaccine find way home. ""not company, problem""

It's company either. attitude message attempts convey never makes way ""evil"" owner CEO, creates work mainly me, also take responsibility whatever reason.

At end day, need make sure shit keeps moving. ""not company, problem"" creates problems work me. can't adapt attitude? Oh, that's right, that, things would suck employees. Maybe care wellbeing employees. Perhaps say ""screw them, company, problem""

That's right! forgot, ""you signed took responsibility"". Damn, sure wish could apply everyone. way, need work damn hard. Oh well. guess 50-60 hour weeks worth five - figure salary. Bling bling!

I hope God never work me. would love spend time family instead deal pispoor attitudes. remember, ""sticking man"", really sticking poor sap decided working hard value. bet type leave carton milk non-refrigerated isle decided want it. Sticking man! Oh wait, poor Walmart employee deal sour milk. That's right! all, ""not company, problem""

Christ, going replace us robots. Good job. already paid everyone $3000+ Covid. ""funzies"". Get damn shot! Grats! rest us need to. Don’t know you’ve noticed, that’s exactly what’s happening around world.  time 12-15s turn comes around they'll 65+  US seriously testing luck coming months. vaccination rates plateauing pitiful percentages anyone thinks required herd immunity, well Israel's likely soon Canada's rates. Meanwhile B.1.617.2 clearly transmissible even B.1.1.7 gaining fast ground US, likely gobble chunk away vaccine efficacy. Actually context, bad lol. community transmission almost 3'months yeah work offered on-shift vaccinations everyone building march. lot call outs couple days lol still move around subset population, much higher degree difficulty. reduces R0 definition, seasonal flu best gets Rt ~1.3. Flu contagious, people can't catch given year. similar recently vaccinated. 

The new import still spread despite everything. saw thing B-117, semi-lockdown work UK went hard lockdown vaccine. 

Point is, even country sitting 40% immunity beat past year, anything prevent variant spread difficult circumstances going rest.  Great news thanks! I’ll keep monitoring situation:)   hate mask **THE** ""trademark"" covid restriction. Masks nuked mental health restriction even close., hate masks always seem absolute baseline always present matter ""holy grail"" covid.

I face entire year outside house, im gonna burn masks big pyre soon mandatebis lifted. Id prefer stick 5 vaccine needles day arm wear wretched piece cloth. CDC finally gives fully maskless OK I'm burning cloth masks catharsis. you’re gross curiosity mean vaccines made mandatory, like flue? Could decrease sick rate quite bit.  mean sure, germ cell affect that’s possible. that’s getting pretty far afield COVID vaccines last week wear mask full 10 hour shifts. know fucking *awful* kind physical labor breath half well used to?

Nevermind acne already clearing week without wearing one, acne I'd never struggled began wearing mask.  Ready tin foil hats Yes faked, one reasons institutions ask pictures, signatures, documentation, etc, prove someone something, also provides concrete foundation fraud cases.

If someone simply comply mandate get vaccinated, would probably let go. someone commit fraud vaccinated, institution could hire legal team begin process putting person gears legal consequences, feet first.

Institutions take lot faith, also keep record every damn thing comes discovery, produce paper trail saying ""we sent notice asking document, person gave us document. took word said was. lied us endangered others lie. Please feed gears."" concerning everyone. Government intervention isn’t always effective. Changing food production approach. Make better quality food, better results. Lol, Canada none.  Dude... allergic reaction ever? 

I MMR vaccine. 

Passing out, hitting head, waking hours later hospital fun. 

I understand vaccines amazing scientific advancement save lives, I'm never getting another vaccine. felt like died. Ib ont know downvoted. Im tired havibg mask covering face soon im outbof house. face alnost year... real tired masks.  western ppl see approach correct. context things like day day SE Asia covid.

We fine overall get time way Asian countries  TDAP? Anything encourages fence sitting morons get vaccinated nonsense. reason considered ok, said “hey, stay Thailand we’ll ship vaccine $2,000,” would considered outrageous. 

What world live in. OMG OMG OMG tyranny! tyranny! elementary school required get MMR whatever way back used power ... keep us healthy. yeah? look huh?   look numbers low enough vaccination high enough sometime July CDC officially says masking end Media care journalism, care clicks revenue. always divisive designed serve narrative. Noam Chomsky devoted lifetime exposing it. funny thing keeping contagious virus control *is* obnoxious nature. Keeping people without immunity getting something contagious difficult requires lot work part unvaccinated.

The hoops they'll jump reality poking face plenty vacation cards give believe crap, want continue work part civilized society. showing mean anything. still trying figure right info pull I'm confident (I used one states vaccine sites months ago) email/phone number enter also needs match sounds it. know mRNA trials human volunteers decade ago? people still fine.  Ah see mean now! Yeah might problem. can't normalize mask-wearing? anything, morons read mistrust said morons takes protect everyone's health safety. 5% good. 

LA county... population greater AZ .5% think. Relax rich boy.  That's doing, quite happy it. wore mask outside private office, need daily check-ins since badge. But, days ago, gave completely enforcement - back ""normal"" - badges - masks required. I'm extremely disappointed, probably go back working remotely. hybrid that's viruses reproduce?   employer us show card cash bonus. taking photo. medical insurance info mine. Nope. Count out.

EDIT: aren’t even mandating confirm got vaccinated not. computerized health screenings gives us option question refuse answer. can't &lt;12. ""we enough vaccines"" problem ""we know safe yet"". Gotta give companies controls. feel risk, allowed let go   Yes yes yes answered question. significantly reduces spread severity meaning hospitals overrun like were. believe lot downturn due us vaccinated. think polio, measles, highly contagious diseases basically nonexistent? vaccines. I'm (Canada) receive vaccination send email. forwarded email employer gave 2 hours pay encourage everyone get it. \~72M doses sitting around unused, 20% total supply (366M). We've got tons supply, rapidly dropping demand.   title indicates *COVID* bad guy, though. CDC. dont understand where, title alone, got anyone playing CDC bad.... appointed man work job there?

That approach makes zero scientific sense vaccines effective enough even 40%-50% population fully inoculated causes community transmission crater.  That's great, maybe make progress older population first. ‘abundance caution’ got one hilarious phrases used  Nepalese , it’s straight forward lot people depend tourism. There’s social security don’t earn don’t eat. also vulnerable virus - enough tests, vaccine availability poor health system. It’s lose/lose situation. Mutations random changes, change works, mutation successful reproduced new host.

So far mutations seeing still use spike proteins infect, mRNA vaccine, targets protein 'educate' body, still effective. 

A mutation rely spike protein would immediately recognized target. Bingo. 5G nanocells

/s I'd rather get infected straight covid.  think agree everything except fact believe people politicians advocating federal state level mandates. say enacted, arguments made speak. Lmao goodluck Sex protected class.

Furthermore, decision doesn’t impact anybody else. Sounds fucking *SMART* me! I've already gotten feels like looks maskless others continuing wear mine. today walked 711, guy checkout (maskeless) girl (masked) eyed didnt return decency nod, went *snap mask straps (like boys bras middle school) stood embarrassed front cashier, frustration growing, actually begging ""knock off, like this""?!* 

People fucking weird. dramatic may seem, whole thing made really consider idea we're all, always, trusting strangers around us absolutely crazy. hate ride, want off. conclusive evidence long last, given seeing wide spread reinfections thinks pretty likely least 6 months closer year point people. reinfections, they've fairly far between. yet know people, contributing towards herd immunity, even can't accurately determine much. Parts Europe crushed early parts fucking nightmare scenario like Italy. Sounds like fellow ILLINI. u/cloudstrifewife   many people oblivious fact takes two countries open border. 

And soon enough, vaccinated travellers. talking California, forgot fully vaccinated would *need* still wear masks. Shit turned around lot fast anyone would've hoped vaccines

I look large swaths planet largely done pandemic new year bad, yes, fully vaccinated people, true. Also another commenter said, businesses mandate masks themselves. Edited comment.  they? hosting new variants keep unvaccinated. Plus amount time money spent parents stay home start getting symptoms age.

2000 kids hospitalized serious covid complications 2020 300 die. sure would loved vaccine.

And lastly don’t know long term effects covid. don’t even know whether covid type virus stay dormant reappear later. rather children covid free. Oh bullshit.
If following scientific method would checked Chinese medical community said loud clear Covid airborne?

Three times. likely collected, studied lab, escaped accidentally, fully rule engineering. truth is, assuming counties going mine is, we’ve wasting doses get shots arms weeks now. county taken “absolutely barriers vaccine” approach meaning even crack whole new vial give one person shot, it. beginning could get every dose used asking random people near clinic wanted shot, days long gone. think pandemics came industrial era? happen disease jumps wildlife us. going happen commonly stop deforestation climate change forces wild animals come communities interact us. next big pandemic be, again, animal interaction. Environmental change clearly catalyst pandemics happening often.  Well, person talking CA. CA align CDC guidance 15th. So, mandates places, others. Also businesses state mandated still decide mandate property. worries resident 1 year old want waste them. work pharmacy extremely hard find people vaccinate towards end work day. least California, people want already gotten them. point, likely due bureaucratic inertia since closed long. suspect it'll get reopened 6/21 since there'll Independence Day Canada Day early July, side want give people good news. angry system designed keep busy run ragged time think. time go hour walk philosophize introspect luxury time luxury world we're in. wealth typically time.

This something trying convince family friend of, hear it. Mostly entire life one financial privilege, due largely generous inheritance late 30s.

The ridiculous thing listening talk importance hard work achieving success, one least motivated least hardworking people ever met. late 60s now, would living poverty inheritance. WHO: *Tucks large bundle money behind back*

WHO: Chinese herbal remedies effective Covid.

WHO: money? Bro legit go get high street drug take medically prescribed vaccine? 

I'm betting 100% single. There's way someone would date someone stupid you. Hell I'm even vaccinated vaccine, I'll take vaccine. Lmfao. Jfc internet NEVER ceases amaze me. I’m loop here...fill please. Assuming genuinely asking - 

Death unlikely, long term complications common, chronic effects unknown, worrisome based long term complications get.

Additionally, even children problems it, still able catch spread others. stopped wearing N95 masks getting vaccinated I'm burning ones left, I'm saving wildfire season.  u/Ryutosuke President, effective immediately! :)  stupid. doesnt matter happened, already know deforestation animal agriculture going make us susceptible future pandemics. need stop living nightmare society gov basically abandons us preparation pandemic prioritizing economy lives. disaster wasnt emergence covid, absolute failure response seemed insane time. 
It still seems insane, I'm getting used insane things. Eh, herd immunity ideally 70% higher. 50% still leaves lot planks bridge virus hop across.

That's take away great news though! hope momentum keeps up. truly tipping point whether going massive success decades long failure truly holdouts. Fortunately experts reaching targeting doctors holdout patients communicating important (and safe) vaccine is. whole sub refers anti vaxxers anti maskers murderers  Smart move Perhaps prevent countries cover incidents costs types labs.  Six people died COVID yesterday Alabama think they're OK vaccine I'm sure SARS initially emerged, almost resurgence escaping lab Beijing twice...  I'm left leaning wrong. many people involved this. Trump completely screwed everything let experts job, mean Biden suddenly person made possible.

I mean ffs, Pfizer vaccine even American made, German. Prizer distributes name it. conclusive evidence far determine long covid immunity lasts. cases reinfection skeptical cautious. Offloading responsibility government minimum-wage workers. It’s bullshit.

A huge load BS sure! Don’t feed trolls everyone.   person replying adding people immune due covid. may correct, simple. people covid got vaccine (I know percentage, personally know one person got vaccinated family caught think means longer need vaccinated), can't add number people survived covid number gotten vaccine. teenagers children little risk serious complications covid. matter? patients several years ago said. one get? unvaccinated ""have become threat other,"" said.

Oh no! Anyway....

Do want see unvaccinated thinking? 

r/Qult_Headquarters show could care less POS swap covid among themselves.  mean job Fauci since 1984? one got Biden took office? nahhh likelihood endgame try grift money tarts, whether consciously unconsciously though... speaking “Democrat”. it’s less politics ppl shutting others cause saying sounds crazy go article says.

Then proceed totally unbased "" China leaned company stop deal force Taiwan accept vaccines via Fosun."" It’s extremely shocking see referring someone doesn’t want get vaccinated and/or mask murderer. They’re lot things, unethical, unsafe, you, they’re actively thinking best kill people. It’s kind thinking makes difficult reach change minds. one variants cold may immunity COVID-19? Cool person merely plane going spread around Chinese people: flyers, workers, etc.. truth money power. Taiwan company secured BionTech deal 30 million shots early last Nov. However, Taiwan government killed deal favor vaccine program.  Would really rather Mexico pandemic? got hit hard, hid numbers keep semblance safe vacation spot. Argentina 10% vaccines stored case.  grocery worker Washington state, fully vaccinated longer wear masks. shrink hospital Belgium got vaccine got manipulated it. colleagues really want it, even doctors.

Why? Belgium 120 people 45 years old (allegedly, leaks proving numbers manipulated) died population 11 million. people dying 95% underlying morbidity diabetes. People like virtually risk grave consequences.

The vaccine protects grave consequences - younger people anyway. yet known whether still pass others, again, likely suffer grave consequences unless they're older, case get vaccine. say mainly vaccinate might risk. Vaccinate rest will. sufficient science impact mutations.

PS: allergies (animals, MI, gluten) suffered grave side effects (skin eyes) needed 2 weeks cortisone vaccin jab. hospital works got vaccine, register side effects colleagues allowed to. do, that's business. Thank HIPAA  Super impressive, still somewhat sad given supply well outpaced demand states. numbers could’ve much higher fairly massive disinformation campaigns prominent leaders. Invest public health laboratories.
Timely, local testing means faster detection, faster public health response whatever nasty things find. grandma wise woman! vaccine-resistant variants. Flat out. One yet exist, it’s sure thing one emerge. did, boosters would available immediately.

Yes. True. New vaccines may may available. thought working disastrous though. possibility there. immune compromised always going continue wear masks longer everybody else. I’m sorry, never alternative that.

My point help continuing mask now. Kids vaccinated around sept help boost herd immunity. crisis phase covid US. Restrictions vary region little bit longer, end emergency arrived.

This important shutdowns. way again. masking simple easy. makes sense keep little longer. mean honestly think pressure continue build businesses eventually stop policing. I'm ones want police decide simpler keep mandates. even feels like half places around getting casual anyway. transition period entities move slower think even late June look looser Jina* borders remaining closed? It’s like rate COVID significantly higher one country compared right now.  Since US taken care population, time vaccine diplomacy. think big thing initially wasn’t ESCAPED lab, literally pretty good idea came from, fact lot conspiracy theorists tried say MADE lab. genetically proven wrong cannot believe read thread people trying make sound ok vaccines going waste.
God help us. good counting? Case loads coming steadily months US, well Canada cases per capita since April. yet, COVID deaths per day still 3 times high per capita compared Canada still. they're voting children punishment.

Nail head. Also, punish women audacity sex. Good news though: yesterday squarely 65% state need 5% close gap. believe that's 50.35% people; prior person's comment *adults*. Right adults teenagers eligible vaccine. Young children yet cleared.

The general herd immunity goal set 70%, approaching value individual subgroups population positive metric towards reaching target. get 70% adults, 70% teenagers 70% children seem relatively do-able (once eligible appropriate) adults people making vaccine decisions younger groups. pure insanity let vaccines go bad millions people Canada countries desperately need want them! know takes two countries open border? nice 😎 post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The crisis phase covid US. Restrictions vary region little bit longer, end emergency arrived. Wow sounds like totally normal expected side effects. That’s false though. Sure survival rate 98-99% long covid affects many that. Let’s check back 5 years see many truly recovered since then. Fake, post title didn’t say Please That's funniest thing I've read long time! ought stand routine LOL

The previous administration said hoax, said would weeks, said inject bleach shove light ass, said masks deep state plot mind control you, said..... dunno, still catch spread covid getting vaccine CDC say us vaccinated folk need masks anymore?  Check Lillingtons.

One guys way, way better. peanut butter analogy, sure that’s fair comparison. someone’s deadly peanut allergy contagious, I’d think world would stop eating peanuts figured stop spreading. issue vaccine argument don’t get vaccinated there’s good chance keep mutating come across variant deadly one protected against. 

The best way saw put people refusing get vaccinated essentially saying want jump cliff instead told do. That’s fine, people free jump cliffs want to, even though we’ve warning that. However, everyone instance tied together enough people decide jump cliff, going them. 

I always appreciate level-headed dialogue regardless opinion. actually think probably agree disagree with. correct. vaccine prevents infection spreading vaccine cases. Also, telling people date information. are: Yes - obligatory vaccines public schooling thing since forever, adding one list trivial matter. sure people getting upset 🤷‍♂️ [Thank God   right. know 10 people died covid. Im exaggerating. 2 bothers dad passed away it. Imagine 2 generations wiped away within matter 3 weeks. complications vaccine rare far outweighs risks catching covid vs vaccination. approved many countries. Dont listen anti-vaccine political nonsense. Base facts. got pretty sick second shot. 36 hrs good go :) Would love one cannot it’s needle 

Just possible can't serious. comment sounds elitist far removed real world working people. Check privilege. Obligatory vaccination thing since forever. I’m sure understand what’s special one?  There’s 39 million people CA masks.  TIL people Karens Obligatory vaccines thing since forever. What’s special one?   good part reason counties breaking Oregon become Idaho. People sick bullshit.   escaped lab, might actually good news new measures could place avoid happening / quicker response happen again.

Now, climate change brought about, taster what's come think we'll able anything really meaningful time soon.

I hope came lab. employer similar thing. 8 hours PTO added send picture completed card. Yeah… near that. 80-95% effectiveness vaccine shitty number. Also, corona viruses play rules. 

It’s gonna around while… like SARS viruses get better… faster vaccine tho. Bangladesh think lottery nonsense? idea much money brings local states/provinces? would refuse wear one required? seems weird inconsiderate people work store. safeguards. step line, put back line.

Weren’t guy (assuming gender username) said problem politicians? think put insafeguards, enforce them? Allowing corporations latitude without safeguard saying safeguards. Profits people heart soul economy, sure give inch corporations take mile. isn’t last step means, it’s also good step make. doubtless seen privacy, rights don’t get restored. 

In /r/collapse community call hopium, people irrationally cling belief things going get better can’t face reality. perhaps optimistic this, especially given current President cozy businesses across country? here, bus driver, usual cold three year. continue mask long drive school bus. mask also much aware whole touching face thing. hands also getting alcohol liver. would thought people lung damage might die people COVID? hospitals overrun ?

when something ""protecting"" LOL

and tactics use scare regular people believe vaccine forcing crazy agenda calling people unsure maddening intellectual moral defects needed push anti-vax line nonsense defining gray area stupid evil. real number probably close 600k Massachusetts. responsibility care dumbass either wearing mask US agency (EEOC) narrow mission protecting employees' civil rights workplace. guidance might survive court challenge unrelated Civil Rights Act.  Cool ! That's stupid. really place time demand international recognition? demand worked part 70 years, really sink vaccine deal right this?

Politics kill. Hopefully contain it. poor understanding public health. Obesity number one public health crisis. Look yourself.. top causes health? ones obesity related? Add medical errors… it’s easily 65-75% deaths. 

Edit: fat ass every fat ass cost money, personally. healthcare system cannot keep fatness. Insurance pays raises rates. go FMLA, disability, call sick. 

Added: business owner.. I’m gonna hire fat people. cost much. ok??

Also, Covid huge correlation poor outcomes obesity. 

And, marketing shitty foods low information people children huge regulated. 

However, make fantastic point, leave alone stay business. I’ll eat McDonalds want. know risk. 

I know risk Covid don’t want put vaccine body. business know why. body choice. get vaccine isn’t 100%, spare lame argument might still get it, can’t get vaccine. problem. 

And.. fat ass vaccinated thus immune , care others do? Honestly? 

Lastly, can’t help distrust big pharma complex. Ya know.. opioids addictive all. Sorry say personally sold line patients YEARS. Turns lie, known lie. many lives ruined? Forever. LIED. government covered pharma got rich. got blamed? Pill mills poor people. 

Point is, scam us over. I’m old enough see now, always wait full year trying anything new.  everyones responsibility care kid. They're way smarter us.  company buys health insurance employees this. Way cheaper give time vaccines pay sick time hospital stays. Doesn’t sound equal opportunity me. There’s lot immuno suppressed people can’t get it. cult/religion people. Everyone must cross become one them. said abjection responsibilities creates consequences high - performing peers. Illustrate case.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* See? Everyone wins! Elections primarily mail. WA mail only, works great, fast easy. generalizing see 🤔 since advent medical science - nothing new here. :) mRNA technology proven safe, necessarily mean future vaccines utilize technology safe effective. doubt ever see vaccine released public use less year circumstances. Yes, inconvenience depressed economy, effective policy responses can, should, provide people emergency situations necessitate extreme precautions.  day really can’t understand wearing mask bothersome people.   mean response still good, Indian variants it’s gotten way difficult contain.  car stopped one lights meant space people merging onto highway. measure speed end onramp calculate acceleration goes 0 65 mph. said equivalent saying ""how know car going lightspeed within couple hours?"". really weird heuristic, would wait longer person's entire lifespan deeming medication safe—possibly even then, since lifespans increasing time.

There constraints possible hundreds years direct indirect data/research lean on. US Vaccine Agency around since 1813—predating first car 73 years. side effects vaccines emerge within days, rarely they'll emerge 3 weeks, extremely extremely rarely it'll take 8 weeks so. Pfizer began human trials 04/23 (after trials rodents macaques), we've extra 49 weeks first 8. larger sample is, greater likelihood catching extreme outliers, well.

The ingredients vaccine hang around body waiting weird interaction. example, mRNA breaks timescale minutes hours translated (read used assemble protein body's nearby 'ingredients'), *is* translated, cell shoots enzyme destroys it. enter cell nucleus point, thus cannot alter DNA, etc. got 5 covid days company (and think put something widespread place like this). 

I take covid time illness, testing taking care others (because WFH never ill), requested two days covid leave second shot work approved it. think flexible system formal, happy worked out. provide proof vaccination. That's crazy, US start donating portion supply point go waste appears face consequences make seem like one, yes, second locusts? say ""union"" loudly bunch poeple understand history claim never done diddly anything us never didn’t yours. 

So stay home. Or, mask up. would fine compensation poor attitude (unwillingness laziness) subordinates greatly increase responsibility.

Besides, attitude subordinates? (not feeling fairly compensated responsibility)

Why fool not? Thats fukked straight up. think New Jersey something like well. State-mandated PTO get vaccine, employer give you, form fill send state. I'm sure additional PTO side effects.  Wayward? Really? Damn cold hearted. believe mRNA vaccines actually designed matter days - trials took time, course production distribution. Certainly global scale production distribution system standby next mRNA vaccine would save many months, trials still needed.

Lockdowns border closures remain primary emergency response. hand, I’m sure get best medical care available country.   incentives automatically coercive nature?

No.

I think means think means.  system rigged, discussion pointless. fact assume conversation like worthwhile assume agency process. 

And time say, “Life experience taught me…” you’ve become guy. Assume rest us fairly broad life experience. Also assume knowledge life complicated gets complicated something you’ve discovered rest us. don’t even need life experience know that. literally ask stranger pass world complicated. You’ll get answer quickly way. 

My point simple. think control situation, must exercise it. Allowing employers require vaccines makes sense numerous reasons. Refusing allow require you’re afraid future hypotheticals valid reason mind. 

Again, put safeguards. step line, put back line. 

And one selling anyone out. That’s is. one selling soul gain here. simply think it’s acceptable business require it’s employees follow government guidance pandemic order protect co-workers. valid reason person avoid vaccine (and fairly rare), exception made. desire prop anti-vaxxer propaganda act business requiring employee vaccinations anything good business good citizenship. idea, don’t want say holy shit bad prison setting. Prisons doors instead bars easier. Keep going. We're done yet. right. ""Nature"" fall neat 12 month segments. given humans Earth operate within standard unit time called ""year,"" probably useful plan vaccine regiments around unit.

The really cool part turns need boosters every 14.85 months, could dose every year make much easier everyone. cool part ""years"" even extended allow longer spacing! Let's say immunity vaccines lasts 52.10 months, then? Would believe told could dose every 4 years? useful time unit, flexible. I've also thought Portugal. Even though I'm 30 years retirement. money parents spend long term care insurance (which feel necessary), retire cheaper place? described situation makes sense, problem honoring came based on, cites, links study Lancet, 198 year old peer-reviewed journal. think Academic Report perfectly reasonable. Vaccinations going fast, speed increasing. time cases going fast. think much reason worry. I’m Nassau north shore. suspect differs area. WORLD problem. need WORLDLY solution. Spread vaccine across world. greedy.  saying, get dishonorable. lowest I'd imagine would General discharge. pretty much heinous shit get dishonorable days. dumbass disbeliever west somewhere last month, ran karaoke event local club, claimed everything could ""wiping microphone singer"". karaoke thing turned superspreader event, something like 15 people got sick least one died. hospitalized like ten days.

She got posted one ""yo, covid real, take seriously, I've changed mind"" videos. comments ""Oh, brave!"", ""Your courage inspiration!"", etc. self-awareness, change, lots back-slapping self-congratulations. guess that's ""thoughts"" part 'thoughts prayers', dunno. need “exit strategy”? hurt people choose wear masks? may never ride public transit without mask, would wear mask cut risk getting sick every single time. True, B.1.617.2 (the Indian variant) could reverse case hospitalization trend, seen UK, cause pandemic last little bit longer Europe. Keep mind seasonality may pretty big factor here, cases falling almost universally across Europe regardless vaccination rate, similar fashion last year. I'm NY see 50/50 masked/unmasked I'm quiet morning hours, skewing slightly towards masked busier times. that's western NY though, NYC, worth. It’s Japan though, they’re good queue lines  demonstrable evidence lockdowns don’t work... *when people don’t actually follow lockdown rules*. Plenty countries shown lockdowns properly executed government people work work well.  two soon!   need force people get vaccine. hate seeing American children suffer!! I’m confused? thought America’s healthcare system sucked? got Canada, hear great guys everyday. Cheers Michigan. Central Illinois. bars restaurants following capacity restrictions awhile. don’t equate personal behavior public policy. also don’t look black-and-white solutions complex problems. also take vitamins. Terrible article number reasons:

1) Absolute Risk Reduction useless comparing different vaccines relies entirely attack rate. attack rate unvaccinated population going vary vaccine vaccinated population has, introducing irrelevant variable. vaccines going see similar real-world conditions efficacy matters.

2) They're using interim report numbers trials. effective vaccines achieve statistical significance fewer cases; 95% effective vaccine show strong divergence two arms quickly, 50% effective vaccine take much longer. end result less effective vaccine tend higher attack rate (because length time interim readout longer) increase ARR. Conversely, effective vaccine lower attack rate interim readout thus smaller ARR.

3) used outdated incomplete numbers. used latest Pfizer numbers late March/early April (which released prior preprint), ARR would 3.3%. Moderna's would similar. AstraZeneca's US trial (which ran time period summer 2020 winter/spring 2021 location) would ARR approximately 0.7% based case numbers (190 32K 76% efficacy).

ARR useful rarer disease balancing side effects vs. risk reduction. Someone taking Ebola vaccine North America going see virtually risk reduction, they'll almost sure never encounter it. someone West Africa would see higher risk reduction, informs whether makes sense vaccinate. None logic applies comparing different vaccines disease based extremely limited trial data.   dunno, rates 12-16s first weeks approval extremely encouraging; see reason 12s wouldn’t follow pattern. people district, least, extremely eager it. 

I still think it’s fairest wait everyone eligible, especially means keeping slight annoyance outsized benefit like indoor masking. late getting MMR little kid parents busy. result, allowed attend school got poke. assholes get damn vaccine. people like working healthcare, anyway?   99.29% take test? mean flu common cold predominant cause respiratory infection NY state? Yes no.

Their legal argument based unsafe. Like construction company required employees wear flip flops. quite bit legal precedence employer able terminate refusing put danger.

They may succeed. However Pfizer vaccine likely get full authorization prior lawsuit resolved. COVID19 vaccine full authorization legal argument anymore. got dose already, 34 year old. neuro-muscular disorder put Phase 3.

I would forget rights second, happy vaccine let avoid hospitalization let live life, even mentally handicapped obviously are, comprehend already.   OP, Johnson &amp; Johnson one dose vaccine available USA 18 older. folks concerned feeling temporarily unwell days (completely varies, people feel unwell, people don't) injection preferred Johnson &amp; Johnson reason. two vaccines available USA two dose. Hope helps! stated employees black? race matters not, stupidity thinking vaccinated get fired. Wrong. That's Friggin Turd effect. Man can’t even imagine shit show America election gone way sad part US hurry complete urgent need doses selves. Lol, get lazy SOBs.  People convinced one dangerous developed quickly.  Yeah that’s still wear mine too. young kids know much sucks basically can’t take shopping all, many belligerent anti-vaxxers going unmasked area. I’m vaccinated, couldn’t tell looking me, obviously. makes someone doesn’t choice leave kids home feel little less anxious, it’s worth slight inconvenience masking. don’t think it’s constructive report deaths daily basis based lags inconsistency state-to-state across globe. Literally everyone needs mind damn business point. People refuse quarantine, wear mask recently, they’re refusing vaccinate. It’s perfect equation chaos. Coworking spaces best compromise. I’d go twice week people age, allow dogs, happy hours events meet everyone. actually win case law federal law leverage

Opinions Reddit something sounds matter. hospital EXTREMELY solid legal ground places used require x-rays tb  italy work hospital/sanity must take it, simply put home without salary months complained things political trying make president lol Good bot ?

Capacity restrictions still effect restaurants, bars, offices, etc. 

Government agencies Secretary State still closed certain locations. 

Chicago may even updating current restrictions alongside rest state next month. 

Where made think restrictions place IL?  open vial, need use doses within six hours. walk-ins there's telling many need many left over. Even solely appointments, people no-shows various reasons, sometimes get extra dose vial. hundreds pharmacies giving doses, there's going left end day, six-hour window doses go unused. Give people want them. seem care approved not. know Americans exactly lining get vaccinated even protesting them. give Countries people actually want vaccinated. giving something away Americans want win win situation right?  No, would still say majority people returning second doses. NY times 40% total US population fully vaccinated, recently hit 50% whole population getting first dose. Seems mostly match honestly. I’ve anxious I’ve kept mask around wrist. hardly handle wearing store. I’m worried someone yelling me. I’ve masking since April last year, fully vaxxed since early March. seem like vast majority anti-vaxxers boomers gen X'ers. got snapped recently one store. can’t win either way. going requirement medical settings United States. far know within businesses institutions rights require vaccinations requirements working business institution. interesting lawsuit follow. question responding different since believe currently required vaccinations for, say, attending public school fully FDA approved. efficacy hold point can't even get FDA approval people pissed forced get participate society. comment: oh nevermind. One people. hope find peace mind. Oof. know Japan good logistics, generally, still seems like nightmare manage. That's exactly add vaccinations + infections. did, would argued well 80% US population immunized (50% vaccination + ~33% infection). argument, fact said ""that brings us close 70%.""

I even stated add both: ""there's least **a third remaining, un-vaccinated, population** relative immunity."" I’m sure that’s correct. think rewards countries vaccine manufacturing centres protectionist governments? health services countries leading vaccine rollouts quite different. bureaucracy's problem DPA still place? Exactly. longer broad public health crisis threatens everybody. It’s basically personal choice thing now. Get shot, not. Mask up, not. Understand personal risk level mind damn business. 

It’s outrageous many people can’t grasp this. vaccines good don’t need herd immunity feel safe. shots you’re done this. People still operating like September 2020 mindset thought we’d getting 50% effective vaccine would need high uptake long, slow downwards slope get back normalcy.

These people, especially dealing high risk patients absolutely made vaccine.

Better wait till something actually done. states let teens get vaxxed without parents' permission :( Leaning towards optimism, 70% quite literally made-up number (calculated degree still made-up) also high likelihood herd immunity reached even sooner given antibodies non-vaccine recipients. It’s also worth noting, herd immunity metric isn’t even important. Behavior simple disease fighting “tools” truly make break work that’s done. Even zero breakthrough cases, new variants and, let’s forget, plenty diseases could cripple us right back quarantine don’t start collectively changing behaviors. nothing major either, simple, basic practices. hope never “get back normal”, that’s got us here. Eh. official number 33m Americans infected; let's round bit say 10% got it.

We're 50% total population vaccinated. split ""infected"" number evenly vaxxed unvaxxed, unvaxxed adding 5% herd immunity numbers.

For dumb reasons, change numbers. God, hate idea much ONE single factory error delay situation ENTIRE country.

It single error; multiple instances cross-contamination (AZ virus got Janssen production line) wrecked multiple batches. prove without doubt specific person gave you. able to. lawsuit would never get ground.  Someone always fuck rest us.  check covid vaccine also check vaccines. want chickenpox outbreak. Ah, gotcha. Hope find peace eventually. Rest Peace, Jim. Sounds like coworkers cared lot you. mean sad people need incentive quite frankly. Haha literally never happened virus. There’s precedent. you’re saying ain’t it. Lol

If simple companies would mandate it. fact haven’t. won’t. think huh? employer taking people word they’re vaccinated allowing people remove masks filling form stating are. later test positive COVID need provide vaccination proof terminated spot fraud. Sounds like BS excuse me. said, don’t believe slippery slopes. They’re fallacy used make bad faith arguments. 

The military-industrial complex, example, result slippery slope. result decades war profiteering, corruption, capitalist greed. It’s like things started sliding control towards current state years ago. move towards current state slow intentional. politicians bend backwards ensure greater greater amounts money spent every year. 

We make choices. choices create present (I don’t mean individualistic sense). sloping path couldn’t stand got us here. previous action directly led one another without possibility changing all. 

Slippery slopes argument made scare people avoid responsibility outcome, nothing more. got tetanus shot yesterday, first time getting jab pharmacy. process super easy, walk up, ask specific vaccine, answer health questions like allergies recent immunizations (&lt;2 weeks), get jabbed.

It still took half hour day, insignificant, time would spending redditing, worry tetanus next 10 years! _""मोदी है तो मुमकिन है।""_ Please stop starting daily posts 'nitwit' insulting terms. health psychology research encouraging people healthy behaviors, vaccinating. Insulting people effective. make people turn away possibility joining 'out"" group (vaccinated people) in-group (not vaccinated people) lady needs jail time. obvious reason convenient time take another inch? Never let crisis go waste. 

All principles, laws norms good times. Vaccinations still hard come Oregon? pandemic, makes sense. End pandemic part getting vaccinated. hard. went many places today wife.. didn’t wear one store required it. places 70% masked.  trend setter.. we’re vaccinated done masks .. MOVING BACK NORMAL could get vaccine works go live life worry people don't. encouraging stupid people get vaccinated. Works better simply paying everyone equivalent amount divided equally. Gee, can't imagine would skeptical white people assuring catch disease. work way verify vaccinations, though. 

That's hard. least Ontario (and probably provinces/territories) tied Health Card (a card everyone provides free healthcare). could probably lie (depending done private business) able lie government. You’re thinking I’m saying vaccinated people safe. I’m saying all. Science says extremely unlikely get infected. agree there. 

The part you’re missing public policy complex that. fine everyone breaking cdc policy ensure unvaccinated remain masked? literally one effective way (besides checking vaccine cards, isn’t practical banned many areas) require everyone. cdc explicitly said fine require everyone. CDC agrees me. care science I’m realistically figuring get unvaccinated remain masked, action really matter this, vaccinated people getting ditch masks effect all. None. 

This part you’re missing:  Whether vaccinated people wear mask doesn’t effect all. cdc really doesn’t give shit do. It’s job hope people take action (dropping masks) effect them. 

It job warn serious risks, like unvaccinated remaining masked, you’re conveniently glossing that, way get happen. Sure go that, able file lawsuit company policy allow certain vaccines? would get laughed courtroom said previous post. logic used it’s company policy much done least understanding point trying get across. I'm perfectly civil, again, tf talking about?

How pandemic started totally irrelevant point. fact US currently leading world fighting coronavirus staggering number vaccinations. people refuse vaccination exist literally every country point US 50% adult population either fully partially vaccinated.

Assuming country effectively battling coronavirus last one rid absurd. aware many places world covid still wreaking havoc? Making ignorant statement makes think completely uninformed situation India.

Seems like hate America. manage people taking time off. means work extra try find coverage work production fill staffing need. also spend extra time tracking sick calls contact tracing. keep track daily health attestations. top normal work. Meanwhile, hourly employees take mini vacations hazard pay. Salary employees get hazard pay. work asses keep ship afloat. got comment deleted mods. lost convo lmao  Making increasingly difficult continue live life force tactics increase numbers since deadly virus Nah, like Europe. cheapest ever seen beginning covid computers trying fill seats, little demand computer kept dropping price, selling tickets 17 dollars. Well, US hoarding, problems. get it, makes sense. Even though things loosed arena paper, really much practice. still wear train bus (that's still required federal level) work, lot places still requiring them, although restaurants eased up. city loosened mandate couple weeks ago, still encouraged places require fully reopen (which saying July 4th, I'm hoping sooner), plenty places continue so, places, especially national chains, went CDC guidelines put signs saying required unvaccinated people, I've started see smattering employees wearing places like Home Depot Walgreens, even almost customers still (I'm fully vaccinated really care). today went Trader Joe's single person wearing one, changes, business usual (wearing mask indoors). expect month now, entirely different situation, welcome arrives. support vaccination 100%, strongly believe best way mess. do, however, also believe wrong happen. happens disagree next mandatory requirement employer? Remember everyone used wear magnetic bracelets? Imagine filled poison Thing is, vast majority spread amongst youngest age groups, teenagers 30. allowed doses yet. spread moment surprising unlikely lead overwhelming increase hospitalisations deaths   state database, they're using track reports reactions, vaccine lot number. reality vacccinated people (outside healthcare workers maybe) generally don’t care much unvaccinated people infect other.

I sympathy people can't get work general I'm gonna hold back dumb people can't stay up-to-date news. Like allowing employees spread disease viruses? Yes... And?

Almost anybody get vaccinated want. There's little make anti-vaxxers get shot.

If want get infected die, let be.  vaccinated

They’re going free they? $20 vaccine vs thousands dollars spent travel. I’m sure understand one better  HIPPA entered chat should! even wait it! Beat punch! get sick stuff time deal fine. don’t see planning you’ll maybe feel bad worse could literally save lives. like things started sliding control towards current state years ago. move towards current state slow intentional. 

Yeah, like corporations continually working worker protections decades centuries. don’t want hand something silver platter, even it’s “for greater good”. It’s slippery slope that’s human works. Things either get better worse. steady march improvement accepted normal part human history, wouldn’t gradually declining conditions civilizations? Isn’t fair bit history that’s basically “and things got worse”? 1.	Not following manufacturers recommendations proven effective strategy. people ~80% immunity much better people ~90% immunity. 3 weeks used Pfizer arbitrary number 

2.	That one province saying *could* used. word federal government provinces afaik weird. I'm fully vaccinated already COVID fear/anxiety level 0%. thought would ready toss mask soon CDC announcement came out, I'm struggling feels weird year. also get scared people judging me. play ear (if people unmasked, wear mine) I'm gradually tending towards wearing it. Today I've 3 places went maskless 2 masked 1 (Walmart). like you, feel silly wear one like bad person don't. little bit mindfuck sure. go find another job?  mean, don’t. actual act commuting best thing world....but it’s worst either. started leaving home early beat rush hour school buses, point commute 45 minutes cruising listening music podcasts.

I suppose could without driving, consider essential physical/geographical separation home work. actually faculty staff live right campus work. would never million years. even rent free. Even living nearby unappealing - know “that guy” lives like 5 minutes away gets called *everything* goes wrong hours everyone knows live close facility. buffer 45 minutes entire county easy way tell people buzz call someone else.

Bringing work home different bringing home work. two separate locations preserves sanity. commute unfortunate side effect that. I’d rather cooped house day every day.  ""not India supporter"" even mean agreed said instead said ""you know talking about"". far spending much time online, look mirror. knocks people extreme fatigue, fever, muscle weakness, migraine. lot people work hourly wage jobs living paycheck paycheck worried missing hours work deal symptoms. empathy.  “The powerful stupid one thing common. Instead altering views fit facts, alter facts fit views...which uncomfortable happen one facts needs altering.”
Doctor first argument, ""I'd rather someone who's needs more"", used valid, absolutely scarcity argument work anymore. Largest vaccine manufacturer general. think people arguing government mandates vaccines? paying attention -- popular idea dangerous one. covid-19 slippery slope future.

Right, OSHA part government. CDC DOJ commands company enforce vaccination requirements, company's decision still government forcing it. Life throws curve balls time. Planning get vaccine makes arm sore day two work though feeling weather extremely lenient curve ball gets. getting common many countries.

Except sources back up. One opinionated scholarly piece 11 years ago link SEZs, exclusive China.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Exactly, fair argument, dont massive longitudinal studies among immunosuppressed cohort, seems like silly standard.  Autonomy* word looking for. cant try sound knowledgeable vaccines saying body anonymity (the condition anonymous). takes away seriousness claims/ statements makes look like know talking about. makes much, much harder contain. whole reason elimination covid possible countries 5 day incubation period. gives contact tracers time find exposed isolate they're infectious. discovery possibility made zero-covid countries abandon flu pandemic plans move elimination. 

The flu 1-2 day incubation period, can't eliminated, mitigated. Covid moved short incubation period, zero-covid countries trouble model longer possible Indian variant. 

Melbourne big test. outbreak Indian variant Covid right now. They're lockdown stop it, succeeded previous outbreaks. can't eliminate way, game changer. Yeah one size fits all. I'm single, live myself, 25 minute drive work. concur.

But family long, annoying commute would much disagree. Covid located Canada curious though, discovered people love masks claim enjoy outdoor sporting events like baseball, stadiums almost full people masks Pediatrician's offices covid tests  appreciate response. suppose point people simply don’t time resources go get vaccine. 

As example, could see single parent, without family friends helping out, work 2-3 jobs minimum wage raise two kids. maybe don’t even car get vaccine site (substantially increasing time needed commute vaccine site). Additionally, order job(s), gotta put kids daycare (especially many schools still closed), substantial amount money top normal expenses. Daycare would, naturally, take heavy toll mental health, furthering issue. 

For some, isn’t matter weekend evening, typical downtime many. people simply downtime and/or physical/mental energy financial resources assets get vaccine. 

What would ideal employers proactive **bring vaccine employees** on-site, preferably pay (their normal wage) sit 15-30 minutes get vaccine.

I guess dipshit sycophants advocate censorship never learn. they're reserved possible michigan residents? I've experienced, people claimed lab said ""man-made"" used weapon. Even wilder theories suggested used specifically attack political side something. think people gave shit THAT.

The idea leaking lab usually followed sort political move agenda make sense. think I've seen anyone claim simply ""leaked"" lab. always saw claims intentional fabricated scientists. possibility we're discussing here. see arguing with, vaccine given thumbs children risk groups age 12, pointing at.

However also believe countries like Israel act admirably well countries stole protective gear vaccines transported countries trying send countries problem much worse - (eg France stealing supplies Spain Italy March/April last year).

I wish people smarter. FL TX continue worst hit states even warmer weather months, terrible policies, care dead Americans. UK's numbers rising again, nowhere close herd immunity. Instead wasting time trying convince people pandemic over, maybe spend time convincing people get vaccinated, cause US still 23,0000 cases daily, 600-700 deaths. reality is, current virus isnt over, less half us population vaccinated. People given stopped caring sides politics, even people die, people wanted get vaccinated it. winter comes, worst corona outbreak ever happen us  Probably not, since generally...didn’t that?

The thing wrong believing country somewhat control spread create million variants. Nice...we MANDATE Vaccine Passports government (the US) afraid Diabetes Squad -_- number vaccine tourists coming miniscule statistically insignificant.

Also, people get vaccinated, faster mess ends. say all!  Ok, looks like we’re caught Navajo Nation, eh?

Ok. Man...I remember reading deaths NYC we’re here. Mind blowing. Wow, surprisingly review-bombed.  10.8 million doses, actually incredibly small number. There’s source there’s concrete evidence, circumstantial. There’s lot theory, mostly China responded pandemic early on. China chaining shut people’s apartments, cutting domestic travel international travel, saying it’s thought airborne China certainly knew point was, etc Also, article failed mention there's additional $5 charge caught ""bragging"" vaccinated.

I like clearly read article, despite posting it. literally second Signs posted windows register Fiddleheads Cafe Lansing Street read: ""$5 FEE ADDED ORDERS PLACED WEARING FACE MASK."" **And fine print message, adds anyone overheard boasting receiving vaccine would get another $5 surcharge.** 0.34% waste rate ridiculous. people really expecting 100% use rate? Shit happens. Wish random American redditors could help.

Thank :) really though. Even came lab put safety measures place, accidents still happen. either way, zoonotic diseases always always thing. 

What actually need look disease allowed spread sustain fully developed countries.  father law California opening June 15. Nice might fall disability discrimination, case already covered existing law. Back early 2020, suggesting could lab would resulted many downvotes.

What's changed? that's partially true. oxford vaccine licensed locally produced name 'covishield'. Another vaccine developed domestically Bharat biotech called 'covaxin' also administered. better way word would that, say COVID 2% death rate, that's 370 lives saved. Again, small number. doses went much vulnerable group, like old, people 370 would saved.  brings new meaning ""The South rise again"" source? I’m sorry ashamed.

Maybe Kate Brown loosen things up? guys call crazy said back february 2020  That’s weird, still see comment, didn’t say anything bad don’t think.

Also, grew Florida live California. People talk shit states time thats true, welcome club. Hmm, maybe.

But trust USA smarter?

Well, little bit. Maybe. Maybe active cases issue? US 5.6 million active cases. Canada 38k. really, suppose thinking makes feel better? Apparently comment replying got deleted used keywords bot like. Anyways, basically boiled fact vaccine uptake controversial thing Alberta, probably listen people claim speak whole Canada. Ironic people literally downright censored people thought came lab, disagreed never treated badly.

I guess habits die hard, they? No, Corona isnt going away another outbreak among unvaccinated still possibility.

But 2 3 USA safe, end hospital Covid-19. Hospitals overflow patients like before.

Even new variants wont change fact people antibodies type.

The pandemic USA Europe. becomes endemic disease UK surging 75% antibodies Population US: nah good Good idea thank amendment again? experience same, actually ended side effects either dose minus arm soreness. Easy peasy nice n breezy think norm people wear masks sick prevent spreading illness others? think polite thoughtful so, plus I've really enjoyed kid getting every passing cold virus usually runs communities fall/winters. You’d first. Pfizer recipients haven’t blood clots. J&amp;J recipients women. muscle soreness even far away injection site reported side effect. It’s harmless, go away. add ""and racist say it"" disclaimer something said, likely..racist. shocking know need understand subject matter discuss, should’ve never replied first place. choice Costing money killing grandma Modi fucked big time. government's fuckup started last year failed buy vaccines upfront although stupid compare countries like US, UK Advanced Economies people expected India do. extremely unfair. lacked solid strategy vaccination government policy makers think through, still white paper detailing national vaccination plan. disastrous thing vaccination program mismanagement vaccination portfolio, reliance vaccine like Novavax pan know government entirely blamed sort stuff bound happen uncertain environment. hedge bets one thing, delivers look like rockstar look stupid. reliance Novavax government portfolio indeed foolish grave miscalculation. US ban exports raw materials help case. Government entirely blame updating Bayesian model became clear Novavax going flop. government also failed understand severity second wave misjudged demand/supply vaccination severe supply side shortage would distress second wave urgency caused it.

Disclaimer I'm write next, apologia government give people idea ground realities, absolutely useless details western consumption, maybe that's reason find mention op-ed pieces written western publications. view Union government fucked written pretty clear. want present political realities country make people give context decisions union government made. abdicate Union government administrative moral responsibilities, Modi administration extremely incompetent political opposition country absolutely vicious self serving. whole pandemic right start extremely politicized vaccination made political issue trend. One fact, opposition tries paint government government cronies. Modi administration pre ordered x amount vaccine paid upfront, would surely become something attack government with. Since happen, opposition leader used vaccine pricing issue label vaccine makers cronies attacked government. Another fact, opposition screamed government decentralized approach comes vaccine procurement. asked willing capable paying vaccine, Union government whole exercise makes sense states it. wanted liberalization procurement vaccines want centralized procurement. commentariat fascination decentralization, federal structure governance States key player decision making nauseous beyond belief. They'll write long, sophisticated pieces issues, fact whole experimentation decentralized procurement made big agenda happened opposition done 180, commentariat stands exposed embarrassed. Another fact, key opposition leaders fuelled doubts homegrown vaccine, labelling BJP's vaccine criticizing government giving emergency use authorization. decision whether suitable use vaccine made government, made technocrats advising clearance firstly provided technocratic bodies. opposition care facts. whole lot another political issues know they'll interest anyone here. Canada does. Change due date add another month date never fair anyone recorded human history.

If attitude point trying discuss you. Best luck. anyone thought point vaccination compulsory? guy Canadians visit US via air vice versa. land borders closed directions. US could technically allow Canadians Mexicans cross via land without side changing rules.   Great news, people eagerly awaiting roadmap forward. Hope he’ll present one! threat detection systems

Technology improving area well. merely week virus discovered RNA sequenced shared world. first tests produced maybe weeks after. approved vaccine less year. 


We need improve timelines communication steps improve preparedness. entire species Go donate blood Red Cross test antibodies. percentage reinfection lower get vaccinated.

I'm sorry, what? saying natural antibodies 1 bout STRONGER get vaccinated. Facebook group told that?

The World Health Organization says people who've already infected get vaccinated coronavirus anyway, unless health care provider tells shouldn't. 

""Even you’ve previous infection, vaccine acts booster strengthens immune response,"" Every hospital clinic wife worked mandated specific vaccines (the U.S.)

I see also mandate covid vaccine. current employer already has. Sounds like good way lose large number customers forever. know I’d never set foot place. Lots good reasons people wear masks, health demands it. Highly ironic accusing Americans entitled criticizing America sharing vaccines paid still many unvaccinated. got second vaccine shot yesterday woke today feeling cold terrible cough achey over. cough seems worse coronavirus last year. normal? trying give example America lockdown implementation? India messed surely it’s India, 70% poor countries shortage never receive. know USA Europe hoarded vaccines still won’t accept crap. pandemic never get rich countries carry poor behaviour. poorly researched Americans going bad time coming East Coast reopen US/Canada border July 1. know New Brunswick plan keeping 2 week quarantine around anyone Atlantic province 75% population fully vaccinated. Hoarding 5 times population creating global shortage plan? That’s evil plan. pandemic never end entire world won’t get vaccinated, guys never learn.   Instead issuing fines, “tackle, vaccinate, release” would amusing policy handling nut-job protestors breaching lockdown restrictions. people stupid use them, send brothers sisters north. no-brainer. huge amount people India, 1.3 Billion exact. could second wave substantial number people immune living side side numbers would unchanged we've witnessed.  know multiple people full vaccinated Canada available mass public. pharmacist seemed optimistic though second doses coming lot sooner originally thought.  February though? lot late?    Covid-19 antibodies still required get vaccine? already know Randy fucked Pangolin.  Agreed, although would clarify ""waiting"" mean administering doses rapidly can. We're targeting go to. Also gotta consider we’re almost reaching 2 billion administered vaccines worldwide. vaccines dangerous, deaths (or severe side effects)? covidiots think countries (that can’t stand sometimes) 100’s 1000s healthcare workers really cover something big? purpose? injecting 5G everyone making us puppets what? can’t top amount crap anti-vaccine idiots making up. “But 5 years something could go wrong!!”, yeah wouldn’t COVID. “But wouldn’t infect COVID purpose”, yeah sure, always prove they’re never wearing masks, social distancing, disinfection whatever else matter. There’s source there’s concrete evidence

Lol Maybe dumbass Indians locked America instead religious festivals masks covid precautions. don’t think I’ve ever seen shortened mln before. That's ""gain function"" research nutshell, though, it? mean, purposely making virus spread easily study it, that's engineering, right? either push nations discontinue research, set higher standard ensuring containment.

I think real point contention people think China purpose, like made disease wanted spread quickly released it, absurd hurt China tremendously known would happen. Occam's razor says happened way diseases spread humans, China normal China thing covered simultaneously watching hospitals overflow building tent hospitals try keep wraps, finally admitting something horrific happening they'd lost control.

A lot money time going spent this, it'll come closing wet markets excoriating China, outlier possibility lab issue demanding higher standards containment. wish could say sanctions would result, see economic ties. Nah, mods hate Trump. long say Orange-man bad they’ll look way. Remember, it’s ok right express political ideas. left isn’t political, they’re “correct” particular echo chamber. all, say takes 1 tango, right? U.S. many countries could done better Except didnt exactly that. feel like living two different realities. Faccui clear saying leave masks healthcare professions back anywhere close amount running them. no, didnt fucking lie us, werent paying attention intentionally spreading misinformation. much change tack reach interval limit second doses. people got first dose nearly six months ago. want three months doses. reaching 3 month point inevitably going hit first dose rate. political sub first health sub second. I've treated handful patients NMO. wish best health going future. I'm happy see well now! fall winter rolls around they'll likely see big uptick states won't. Perhaps convince them. Probably not. Inb4 ""but that's island count"" people arrive cant open borders safely get people fully vaccinated here. partially. One biggest issue spread pandemic 'was' &amp; still 'is' International Travel. Countries take much time thinking &amp; analyzing. needs strict global protocol. private companies release ship vaccines

Who says want anything stop Biden administration shipping finished doses owns executives government officials said clause inserted original contracts signed Donald Trump’s administration vaccine makers, banned government exporting doses owned. Officials said **drugmakers wanted clause protect possible lawsuits people overseas claiming US-made doses made ill**. good results mean conditions reproduced real life. concert even security guards toilets make sure people wearing masks properly.  Same. anxiety lack therapy due masking said anxiety, getting f-ing sick people saying masking big deal.

I've done it, people huge sacrifice. kind silly. like saying ""we need know climate change emerged need stop happening again"". emerged lifestyle. way expand territory terraform wildlands caused happen introducing closer contact animals changing lifecycle environment well ours. 

There way ""stop happening again"" . Pandemic preparedness way deal would want Americans change prevent future pandemic? don’t get you’re saying. I'm worried young children, far less contagious get it. Keeping *everyone* home never going possible 21st century. People hospital every day, hospital staff still show up. Law enforcement would still out, human nature. agricultural workers don’t show up, food rotting field two weeks, unfed animals. Obviously can’t that. could probably shut non-food manufacturing, closed commercial food plants, you’ve got ingredients expiring, suppliers also closed, it’ll take even longer replace them, shortage bread. doesn’t go well. 

Once exempt people essential medical care, law enforcement, food supply chain, really *can’t* get full lock down. Yes, could done better did, allowed Jo-Ann Fabrics GameStop say “essential,” also, lot people underestimate many people really, genuinely would still go work keep lockdown possibly worse disease. like already fully vaccinated months, hopeful bits need hear *finally* reopen ditch godawful masks... I'm saving cloth ones scrapbook. Burning rest. it’s following rules fully vaccinated people quarantine entering Canada archaic. one hand vaccines extremely effective, according Canadian government, hand, doesn’t matter people fully vaccinated …? Maybe need look word “archaic.” point, Americans safer Canadians vaccine rollout far superior states. policies implemented lag behind science considerably. hotel quarantine another absurd policy. 

A lot policies seem like political theater point. adulation nerds, financial bonus this? positive percentage 40 percent large parts pandemic. Obviously 11 percent recorded cases significantly counted. anecdotally work home co workers to, counted half friends coworkers got infected, Thanksgiving Christmas, thats people worked home.  
So sorry here. never social distancing masks again. much Reddit wishes true, regardless here. lab no? Yes, is. seems good portion population doesn’t respond science rationality, here’s are. even read article?  think another month 2, mentality ensure others feel safe wearing mask, despite fact vaccinated. Maybe people waited bit ensure vaccine unintended effects, able get yet. 2 months so, mentality shift ""okay yeah, vaccinated now, able to"". saw signs WALK-IN vaccinations local Walgreens - toooo much excuse area point, aside medical exceptions incredibly stupid that? Anyone easily trained administer things. even find vein. airborne. What. Literally major vaccines effective every variant come out. Companies major research boosters chance new dangerous variant come isn’t covered vaccine able get protection fairly quickly. I’m double vaccinated since Feb. pandemic me, I’m waiting 100% people get vax’d 100% people never will.  Ah, mythical ""rational person"".

The reason unpreparedness. shipped planes full protective gear February China. used influenza protocol COVID unwilling see shortcomings. failed work together institutes abroad. downplayed severity risk late. 

Good governance. Look up. failed account:

- accountability
- transparency
- participatory decision making
- effectivity efficiency

Imagine way Alabama like ""nah"" hate last admin much next guy, US system government culture set pandemic. 

The federal government doesn’t power issue mask mandates lockdowns 50 states. government constitutionally power restrict interstate travel prevent spread virus. It’s state governments right thing, half give middle finger federal government they’re still upset losing war 150 years ago. can’t count nearly 50% Americans right thing absence mandates reasons, everything polarized politicized. 

I think things may bit better literally anyone else charge 2020, still wouldn’t great. 96% genetic match still many mutational generations apart. Humans 98.8% genetically similar great apes, 90% similar mice. One point contention that, date, none generational gradations found. naturally occurring virus go found bat, directly SARS-CoV-2, impossible. Now, obviously isn’t proof, it’s piece evidence pointing lab breakout natural occurrence theory.

We also know Dr. Shi Zhengli’s lab Biohazard Safety Level 4 facility operating time virus’ emergence. argument whether lab conducting gain-of-function research coronaviruses, Dr. Fauci adamantly stated NIH/NIAID grant given include gain-of-function approval. 

(As aside, thought read Newsweek article stating grant renewal provide gain-of-function research, can’t find cite, I’m going assume wrong. recent info found transcript exchange Sen. Rand Dr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci stated gain-of-function allowance).

FDA given full approval vaccine yet? legally force something even fully approved. Really trying argue clip posted imbedded article posted. 

It March 8th interview. 

In clip, Dr Fauci says “There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.” 

Prior statement said:

“ right people walking around masks” 

Now fair, say infected people wear time March idea wasn’t infected. 

The next guidance didn’t come till April 3rd

“The interview predates CDC’s updated guidance use face coverings. April 3, 2020, CDC updated previous advice recommended people wear cloth face coverings “in public settings around people outside household, especially social distancing measures difficult maintain.” “

Look understand early March thru April lot knowing things virus. 
And things changed quickly. 

Also, undated interview admits originally said need masks say said may change future. 

Which course happen. 

I also believe ppl hanging onto “he said masks flip flopped” idiots, 
There’s logical reason change time info became available. 

 Hey like doc, facts facts. words. assuming vaccinating drunk people? Unless test every single vial still playing odds, safe way guarantee rest batch reacts way time... governments offered degree flexibility prioritize inoculations — condition promise finish giving shots people 65 older end July — Japan's minister charge vaccine rollout said.

It looks like Japan finally starting engage vaccination serious levels. Maybe infection countries around spurring movement? Maybe Olympics? It’s good see. Good grief that's horrible, given population size, looks like #2 total reported deaths #10 per capita, per capita much smaller countries. Compared everything else, practically disadvantages.

Ok “co-owners” force physically dont let return. Cops won’t anything since it’s civil matter.  realize need get something close 660 million population fully vaccinated (this excluding possibility people getting one done vaccines)  check see it’s still okay.

How one though?

Visually, taste smell?

The true way give shot wait see adverse reactions... killing grandma… everyone else’s. Coronaviruses family viruses. lot infect humans (many infect bats). Right now, 7 members family infect humans. 4 typically cause cold (together they're responsible 15% colds). 3 cause serious disease: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV SARS-CoV-2.

The first human coronaviruses likely emerged thousands years ago. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 much newer, first popping among humans last 20 years. there’s also bunch people like mom (mid 70’s) refuses get friends aren’t either. *sigh* silly, serological studies U.K. late Jan (when vaccine numbers low) indicated 14% population antibodies. NZ may need inoculate % U.K. achieve response, big deal certainly reason expect NZ different approach. Employers aren’t required abide constitution. literally explaining thing everyone thread, even entire USA’s population get inoculated twice, still 300 million doses left you. Thats called hoarding. Read article sent. agree competent making sense. standards place protect public. FDA approval one standards. circumventing standard time. Why? push hard? 

They SAY care health. know really care money. don’t care population eating misery death. 

Michelle Obama advocate better meals. applaud effort. school age children’s meals fine. great, ok. get breakfast lunch. School meals making kids fat first place. campaign effective? kids healthier intervention? easy measure.

Preventative care become free. Supposedly. colonoscopy cost $800. free… even affordable. shitty sounds, that’s problem. India isn’t “third world country” like countries South America &amp; Africa. India actually ranks worlds top 10 wealthiest nations worldwide along United States, UK, China, France, Spain, South Korea, etc. India nation means handle virus like US, European countries Japan like brought up. end day it’s people power India first take action early protect citizens spread, second secure vaccines means vaccines people. Indian leadership neither. Sure, chances lose job don’t 

Or allowed fly/go events/eat certain restaurants/go stores/not allowed public transport possibly afew things cannot remember top head 

Heck places say fine don’t 

Sure going taken forced will, life going become absolute nightmare don’t  related health involves needles going body? Highly debatable...

Because health well-being people considered choice show work not.

Da fuck, Iceland's airport busy AF tourists Chinese.  Actually countries better prepared handled much better. There's weather factor Covid well, warm tropical climates reduce Rnaught Covid.

However, variants 'tame' tropical climates now, psosibly happened due selective pressure virus. 

Now see outbreaks arising places claimed beat Covid-19. sound like scientific advice. People right know. Relative Canada, conservative. Even chart backs point, largely line conservative edge.

Do questions US general population come back me.  How?

Most COVID death aren’t even listed COVID. Even came nature still investigated lab. Great, let's start producing free vaccines non-Americans. We're hemhorraging support world stage due continued funding weapons support terrorism abroad instead basic needs, foreign aid...the list goes on.

It's never late right thing, American government literally avoids cost. Take that, anti-vaxxers. Ya maroons. India highest number Covid cases early 2020 based timeline infection. didn’t they?

Science religion ""believe in"" nursing ""science filled job"". Nursing following set protocols deliver patient care, researching new technologies. really speed things along...Pfizer first market US funded

Moderna US funded, makes 40+% US vaccines used far, licensed precisely 1 week Pfizer no, that's really true. supply may well investment.

Honestly, 14% pretty good data point. thinking rare side effects category. best red. simply true private business refuses hire black people would law. don’t get lick choose  They’re almost 12 month mark blood draws phase 3. believe would June/July. get mine mid September. thought scientists suppose look truth? worry online bullying. Strange world live in. Mostly US sure I’m at. masks comfortable. various illnesses caught 2-3x year pre-Covid not. People disgusting like mask protects portion lung juices. Must fun way live don’t think anyone saying virus created inside lab per se. theorize simply first human infection event happened inside lab accident. probably engineered 2015.  people hospitalized COVID-19 reported sharing air people point, film 11. 🙄

The results masks vs results vaccines different enough justify claim masks implemented don’t work. don’t prevent spread. Social distancing, effective contact tracing quarantine, vaccines do. Thanks thoughtful real reply unlike virtue vultures thinking I’m stirring fear.  don't. take eyes pandemic risks blame Chaiye-nah. hysterical drabble hyper politicized partisan. Keep propping 1%. thigh… arm got shot sneezed? cliffs u go Sparta style switching, read able to….


As Pfizer, will. time. focused trials kids right full FDA approval. Let’s get first. Well augment risk ""theres better chance dont get vaccinated wont get COVID,"" true, risk high enough weigh much higher ""There may unknown completely unexpected side effect vaccines"" aren’t cases UK going rn? Imagine writing something dumb thinking funny. Moderna. mom telling - she’s mad got Pfizer haven’t announced similar plans she’d rather get one booster. can, she’ll switch booster. courts? cares agency says. Turned 30 earlier year got first jab yesterday North Yorkshire, booked last Monday get text. girl booth next 28. interesting many people say rights.

They may US. [They would goes back state labor boards states, labor boards real employee friendly, throw state unemployement department. process difficult fire workers. Seen near 50 years working management side several saw one big groups looking combined vaccine would make things super simple. know masks importantly staying home prevented getting cold recently. notice flair take chances got vaccinated anyway. humans chimps share 96 percent DNA sequence. interesting applies flu vaccine going forward. Policies flu vaccine common hospitals easily skirted due “religious objections.” argument can’t used covid vaccine, negate flu vaccine? understand protected anti-discrimination laws shift favor public health laws, I’m it. scroll DAMN FAR find comment. Thank you. study prior screening via antigen tests. Apparently “jag” Scotland news me. purpose study determine effectiveness prior screening antigen tests. super effective.  think antibodies wane away time aren’t picked tests. population still immunity. lots empathy advocate people get vaccinated get yourself, dont need much that. dont much obligation people wont protect themselves. People right screaming whole virus ploy control hurt president…it wasn’t 

People left blaming side increased deaths, following rules, accusing clinging ideals right. 

Both sides guilty making political. It’s front you. campaign trail now. work together “bunch Neanderthals” 

Again, sorry disagree, that’s choice. 

I know many liberals won’t vaccinate well many right won’t. actually know lot people identify “right” vaccinated early. Don’t bother Snow man. guy wants perpetual mandates won’t settle anything less zero Covid deaths ever future. hard time coming realization world going back normal him, numbers support pandemic ending. It’s hot topic it’s politics ignorant conspiracy theorists. Every politician wants get power base side, costs nothing blame lab China. please let us enter US we've vaccinated :( gf lives Ontario, want see her, to:

1. Get government approval family exception (thankfully able get recently)
2. Get tested within 3 days prior entering
3. Get tested border
4. Use take-home kit give test day 8
5. Quarantine 14 days

Testing whatever, quarantine requirement...ugh!

All vaccinated... *le sigh* I’m looking empirical data provides quantifiable measurement around individual U.S. cities handled lockdown. I’m trying assess risk reopening businesses various cities future outbreak/wave. Right current vaccination rates, good benchmark showing acceptance. However, doesn’t factor city like Atlanta, &lt;40% vaccination, fact city remained relatively open compared LA/Seattle. Colds caused multiple viruses -- coronavjruses relatively small portion.

It's likely due distancing masks, come contact many cold viruses. masks coke off, time start circulating (and cold flu season well).    wondering China-lab-caused-the-pandemic idea suddenly hot topic.

Some good sources:


- “The evidence people lab leak lab Wuhan.”

- “If someone seeking engineer new coronavirus pathogen, would constructed backbone virus known cause Someone get HIPAA horn 20 years ago things changed get information. Russian one seems effictive, maybe even effective all. Might propaganda, we'll find soon enough, approval state outside Russia words, orphans make fantastic cannon fodder. Europe wide data this, took data larger European countries. see true test positivity. countries currently higher, others much lower well. Also, Europe came third wave, saw higher normal test positivity, normal. countries, including US, higher test positivity waves.

And even worst country list, Netherlands, enormous test capacity testing sites everywhere, demand. get appointment day get results back within day well. much testing capacity utilized here. Also, lots testing sites everywhere. could cycle nearby testing site. sperate home testing, testing private test locations testing travel/events. low demand  booster around 6 months great idea. mRNA would best; we'll probably multivalent shots then. 

Sinopharm pretty close 100% effective severe disease death though.   It’s true, haven’t started 30’s unless risk. Canada pass uk first doses next days well. least week board gave federal government advisement border measures. takeaways fully vaccinated people quarantaine, take test border monitor situation. Don’t need job things, sure need money fund those. Plus, coronavirus immunity past (SARS) instance pretty durable too. full vaccination population , it’ll go away.  NB. could get AZ 55 vaccines stopped first doses AZ giving second doses.

I ""strong immune response"" first dose nothing second. would deliver 5 million delivered many used? would literally taking 4,963,000 doses away Michigan would’ve otherwise used there.  United States America(the nation use offensively), United Kingdom, France, China, Russia(All 5 Permanent members UNSC), India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel. vaccines new side effects come well initial vaccination, organizations understand science concerned that. (Also far know, OSHA requires record side effects rather liability, know much.)   logic anyone BS scientist, isn’t accurate. knew exactly meant since must argue something come with. Ok buddy. get point. Well done TLDR: know yet. That's definitely something look into, although much better many predicted far ability get vaccine wanted.

It's funny see haters getting proven wrong.  crap hope go US route. Spain we're pretty much back normal, aside full nightlife still masks, yet still feel like shit. hate mask always present measure, ""base"" measure. I'd rather curfews still wear mask ALWAYS i'm house. know reasons bit oddly specific spent decade self improvement, achieved first time finally liking see mirror, month later mask put face.

It real kick guts im 30's TERRIFIED spending best looking years mask face, losing youth forever piece cloth. age behind mask wtihout chance enjoy world visage i'm confortable (im brad pitt anything, fisrst time long time truly confortable body), im going go insane, specially worked hard long it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd rather put daily vaccine horse syringe keep covering face mask. Sorry personal rant masks driven lowest low mental state life. media critical vaccines government done campaign address this.

We AZ (which make locally) Pfizer. moment health directive 50s can't get AZ.

We're due get shipments next weeks. Big ones coming towards end year.

The government slow roll-out. many people relatively normal life bothered getting it. small outbreak happening fire lit. 

For me, rely international students work honestly can't wait shit get back normal. Dude, cool jets. obviously going away soon worn people want look sporting event 20 percent people wearing them. every article masks masks that. Monetizing internet fame you. aren’t scientists technically either.

Not true. Even though (in US least) MD Ph.D two different things, even hold former, understanding taking part medical research still part training, often part job (even lesser extent Ph.D MD-Ph.D). unlike Iraq, China actually WMD world knows it.

When accused WMD, always actually WMD. I’m gonna need source this, everything I’ve read says they’re effective. never really UK. People overwhelming always got vaccinated anyway.

Anti-Vaxxers modern phenomenon.  Accordingly Republicans, Canadians threat. even then, Russian Chinese ones hardly work. got Moderna, feel like want get shot Pfizer cover bases haha  worries good luck! would idea could qualified gp didn’t call me, hope get sorted soon too. Mendocino. place granola. enjoy it.

Why owner would beyond me. far arrears hoping huge windfall?  kind logic that? point truth people won’t believe it? find truth make plans prevent/mitigate next time. Sure I’ll bite. 

When vaccines finally fully approved (which far away), no-doubt confidently spoken wrong rationalization still trusting them? Well known authoritarian, surveillance,collectivist dystopias like... New Zealand? That’s flu vaccine completely eliminated flu right?

Flu vaccine much less effective covid vaccine, uptake flu vaccine extremely low, many strains flu vaccinated once.

There's reason can't like polio measles, barely exist anywhere except pockets non-vaccinated people. Well Americans taking jab might well send somewhere. protected healthier. pressure worked. Probably requires others even need tackle release part. get bunch tranquilizer guns fill darts vaccine. Pet theory: maybe efficacy less important measure days even unvaccinated benefiting less virus circulating, precisely vaccine. true efficacy stat might 80-90%+ numbers we're used seeing, fault vaccine itself.

But CDC want anyone know they're terrified low efficacy stat means wave bye-bye herd immunity people bother trying understand above. much probably would true.

I've heard passing somewhere unvaccinated people actually still continuing pretty poorly though, could way off. way getting jab me. waiting long this. moment 40s older get it. 50s older weeks get many haven't. Stupid vaccine hesitancy  think doctor faced criminal charges vaccinated wife last possible second diving around kingdom come calling friends friends friends trying used last half dozen vaccines end day early days. Bangladesh predominantly Muslim country. Probably many went Kumbh Mela festival.
But due proximity two countries, reasonable concerns spread variant matter when, if. addition President creating non-stop fights China. 
If thing happened Mexico, I’d skeptical Presidents rhetoric. said thing Canada, I’d little less skeptical. worries. Thanks confirmation GP -- I'll call week. 


Thanks posting, otherwise likely would waited July. tested positive PCR last August. Never felt thing. So, maybe that's why.  Yeah, know someone still reserve force one year, get vaccine, go vacation late summer like always wanted to, he's happy. 100 employees joined lawsuit Houston Methodist hospital Texas requiring employees get COVID-19 network, oversees eight hospitals 26,000 employees, gave workers deadline June 7 get vaccine. not, staffers risk suspension termination, according result, 117 employees joined lawsuit filed Friday Montgomery County alleges hospital ""illegally requiring employees injected experimental vaccine condition lawsuit cited U.S. Food Drug Administration issued first emergency use authorization COVID-19 December 2020, vaccines awaiting full FDA approval licensing, likely take months agency review additional data. it’s inept government then? Vaccine protection lasts longer reliable antibody protection. facts fit narrative want, ignore start cherry pick statistics.

I’m surprised wasn’t fatal World's scientists: almost absolutely sure come lab. Also wear masks. 

American politics: came lab masks?!?!? Really, Iran Crisis, 911 (we took rerouted planes), send fire fighters California wild fires, supported US Middle East decades. Well, write within 100 words? Let's go 367 words. 1 minute 20 seconds reading.

 crisis, multiple phases: 

* identifying possible threat, 
* understanding nature threat, 
* understanding impact threat various resources relative risk, 
* identifying possible methods (mitigations) alleviate threats resources, 
* choosing right methods (mitigations)
* forming methods set policies laws
* communicating population steps
* monitoring effects policies adjusting necessary

Each phases 'kind of' happen parallel involve many different parties. time takes go phases level complexity depends greatly preparedness. 

As imagine, state insufficiently prepared, complexity turn chaos. structured approach goes window see contradictory advice, insufficient communication outside parties, muddled accountability, cohesion lost, decision making becomes inefficient ineffective, moral judgement lost, state laws broken.

Chaos inherently bad, requires completely different approach 'usual' crisis management. 

There quite evidence Dutch policy making became chaotic. Contradictions w.r.t. aerosols. Insufficient threat analysis within nursing homes. Steering wrong measurements (# infections / day instead Rt). Wrong communication strategy (RIVM / OMT communicated directly first, instead via cabinet). 

It important understand failings occurred decades leading crisis. example, institutes NCC (Nationaal Crisiscentrum), ICCb (Interdepartmentale Commissie Crisisbeheersing). they? setup international connections order tackle continental global threats prepared fashion? so, become operational?

Lastly, RIVM known better downplay risk January Februari 2020. two important metrics define risk impact transmissible disease: R0 (basic reproduction number, speed spread) IFR (infection fatality ratio, number people dying disease). already estimated high January February.

Curious: happens within 90 days? clearly accused “coming you” nothing close ever happened. I'm totally individual institutions right decide vaccines employees need have. That's topic that's definitely beyond scope random business people.

Some professions definitely (and already do) require certain vaccines, consistent across jurisdiction least nations, ideally globally.

Goodbye. one forced get “experimental medical treatment” one forced work there.

Good point. It’s though. It’s 15 cancer patients unvaccinated nurse see day. That’s 15 lives put genuine harms way someone doesn’t feel like assed getting jab.

yet believe choice wants get vaccine ? know everyone dies Covid, right? Can't understand article , india till Today india administered 200 million vaccine one highest world compare wrt population percentage 5% something..If india purchase enough "" vaccine"" population anyways would effected world...

 Yea, fuck every 50th every 100th person dies. Meh. Never liked aunt anyway. small town butcher asshole too. Good riddance goes. Oh kindergarten teacher called son idiot. next!

God heaven. People. :(  texas completely mask free? cases since? You’re right, here’s downvote.  guess hear COVID cluster Alabama coming months. “Yeah got evidence extraordinary claim trust bro.”   strange consider incentives look older seem outside. risk Covid spreading outside even among unvaccinated people minuscule.

Seriously though, I’m using stat anytime somebody tries lecture masking anymore I’ve shots. extremely important question answer know conduct moving forwards

If spillover, avoid farming contact animals prevent next one increase gain function research try get ahead new viruses emerge. 

If lab, ramp biosafety labs dramatically reduce funding gain function research. I'm Illinois. open?  Oh OK private businesses access health records. That's cool. 99% people.


Ignoring fact database would nearly impossible securely build distribute every private company (there national DB drivers licenses....) *that's Healthcare related thing*. 

Should national database people mental conditions? not? bureaucracy main reason slow. tens millions doses could administered (Following one-dose approach could vaccinated nearly half population already), government moves really slowly comes things like this. got snapped old guy grocery store. Covid broke many brains. Assuming you’re vaccinated, wearing mask absolutely nothing help people. allow feel smug self righteous though, that’s nice. learned nursing school blood tests vaccines part job. think weird people ok handling medications bare hands, exposing communicable diseases, sometimes handling chemotherapy, reason vaccine scares them. Sorry, signed this. completely agree. 

It's failure either though. Canada best without domestic manufacturing US export bans. USA really well massive industrial capacity. 

The USA definitely consider selling doses us though expense Canadian taxpayer. time, vaccine tourism much better economically millions people would come spending thousands dollars well getting vaccinated. I'm amazed case positivity low relative vaxxed. health care worker LBC (talk radio) morning argued no-one would sheet e many people died within 3 weeks vaccination - regardless cause.... health worker, hospital, contact patients. person allowed near hospital, let alone working hospital patients. article interesting analysis two potential scenarios:
- C19 mistaken lab leak result Gain Function research (in China partially funded USA)
- C19 natural zoonotic (animal human) spread; bat human, either intermediary make conclusion, fair analysis. perhaps wanted err side caution? zero evidence suggest natural spillover. tested 80k animals, zero positive. YES instead large prizes small prizes winners Mods high alert one know States individually. Medical issues, including decided states government offices. know state handle it. take account CDC recommendation, maybe OSHA. thinking rare side effects category

This commented above, talking side effects able take vaccine several underlying health conditions. discuss endlessly long talking pears I'm talking apples gonna get far.  True. need know truth, however inconvenient. blame bureaucracy that, would started exporting weeks ago slow process allowing happen. Still required everywhere Oregon Many health care settings pre-COVID would require wear mask work get flu shot.

We could easily refuse COVID shot, except uncomfortable N95 mask face shield. would stick like sore thumb others get wear cloth/surgical masks even go maskless. YES Except 'WMDs' public knowledge. Look paper published WIV. create chimeric bat coronaviruses. entire job 'dire warners' scientists ashamed. world needs know truth, regardless political inconvenience threat personal funding sources. 

Remember list much famous well regarded scientists, including worlds' foremost expert coronaviruses trained PI WIV, called full investigation recent Science article. Another factor much dependence nations, dropping ball. China failing report emergence, US failing dismantling early warning response, Canada dismantling vaccine production capacity. many nations left result many others wide open. handful nations extremely self sufficient and/or culture allowed easily control movement thus viruses spread able stop it. Even China struggled first despite massively totalitarian. Looking graph fully vaccinated people US, behaving like catch number people first doses 3-4 weeks. Looks like non-trivial number people delaying / skipping second dose? Apparently get get world believe ridiculous pro-Trump fanfic, can't get decorate fun stuff Halloween like here. Smh. hilarious accuse lying blatantly lying paragraph. 

It says right CDC website one risk serious side effects, extremely rare allergy, occurred less 200 people, even long term damage. way test allergy now, newly discovered allergy due covid vaccine's unique nature, ONE BILLION people taken vaccine without anyone dying.

Not able identify wrong really serious character flaw, hard life fix it. It’s interesting single word discourse mentions individual/personal responsibility. Thanks proving point fellow readers. preaching choir regarding failings government, that’s exactly point, even doesn’t exonerate individuals responsibilities. live UK classes extremely vulnerable. Unfortunately due medical condition vaccines work completely rely others vaccinated.

Like many others situation often visit Hospitals.

The rules UK follows..

Staff involved direct patient care 

This includes staff regular clinical contact patients directly involved patient care. includes doctors, dentists, midwives 
and nurses, paramedics ambulance drivers, occupational therapists, 
physiotherapists radiographers. Students trainees disciplines volunteers working patients must also included. 
Routine vaccination 

All staff date routine immunisations, e.g. tetanus, 
diphtheria, polio MMR. MMR vaccine especially important 
context ability staff transmit measles rubella infections 
vulnerable groups. healthcare workers may need MMR vaccination 
their benefit, also immune measles rubella order assist protecting patients. Satisfactory evidence protection would 
include documentation received two doses MMR 
positive antibody tests measles rubella. 

Selected vaccines 

BCG 

BCG vaccine recommended healthcare workers may close 
contact infectious patients. particularly important test 
immunise staff working maternity paediatric departments 
departments patients likely immunocompromised, e.g. 
transplant, oncology HIV units (see Chapter 32 TB). Hepatitis B 
Hepatitis B vaccination recommended healthcare workers may direct contact patients’ blood blood-stained body fluids. includesany staff risk injury blood-contaminated sharp instruments, deliberately injured bitten patients. Antibody titres hepatitis B checked one four months completion primary course vaccine. information allows appropriate decisions made concerning post-exposure prophylaxis following known suspected exposure virus. 

Influenza 

Influenza immunisation helps prevent influenza staff may also reduce transmission influenza vulnerable patients. Influenza vaccination therefore recommended healthcare workers directly involved patient care, offered influenza immunisation 
annual basis. 

Varicella 

Varicella vaccine recommended susceptible healthcare workers direct patient contact. definite history chickenpox herpes zoster considered protected. Healthcare workers negative uncertain history chickenpox herpes zoster serologically tested vaccine offered without varicella zoster antibody.

My ZIP code 48% one dose 41% two. puts us solidly middle pack NYC. look significant disparities. USA still restrictions exports vaccines raw materials despite one vaccinated countries world. US started donate some, anywhere near exported EU, China India.

There global shortage vaccines, issue cost rather availability. Easening export restrictions would help rest world lot right now.   De-volving get. We've always get vaccines. new one. standard operating procedure since forever. probably wasn't. Dude, vaginas don’t spread disease toilets… 😂 Ideally EU countries stage since vaccines supposed divided equally members.

Still waiting turn well Sweden (37 yo). They're currently booking 40 live. We're still getting \~500k doses week plan give 1.2 million doses per week. think don’t know community members? ever New York City?

Great questions. First all, somebody else explained wet market. Second, like commentor introduced topic climate change, I'm saying climate change *is* cause pandemic, **might** be, that's important possibility that's widely entertained.

And I'll point out, *was* lab leak, reason Chinese government might studying coronaviruses bats, first place, threat increased bat-human contact poses unleashing novel infectious zoonoses less animals relocating humans eating weird dodgy things?

Humans eating weird dodgy things is, fact, facet animals relocating: wild animal ranges change, sometimes brings contact humans hunt food. That, btw, one theories origin HIV humans: somebody ate monkey.

Also, wild animals encountering domestic animals (birds, pigs, e.g.) pass zoonosis animals tend eat. already facilities single use syringes. could repurposed expanded vaccine. world obviously needs vial production maximum still.

And also colossal money waste, pay per dose, per vial. every vial mostly unused hundred dollars window. Small study small sample size. quite hard study requires fair sized group constantly testing. Variants could change well.

The numbers could end fair bit higher lower given larger sample size. Pzifer Moderna vaccines used study also effective many vaccines. look up. pandemic looked list local places got loan. didnt exist, others got big loan, laid everyone anyway, crying cant hire anyone I'm little skeptical nature would fall neat 12 month annual booster regiment. preliminary estimates natural immunity prior covid infection last years mRNA vaccines promotes robust immune response natural infection, would annual booster necessary?

China several different vaccines varying efficacy. notably, Sinovac seems relatively low efficacy (although varying claims). still good preventing deaths, probably much worse preventing mild infections spread e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech (single-dose mRNA seems par better two doses Sinovac).

Sinovac still good, probably need doses achieve effect population level used e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna.  trying educate you. 

Actually, ilovefb brought idea states. ""Vaccines reserved Michigan residents.""

Last checked, Michigan still state.  choice m8 can't push people.. trust vaccine men’s room guy. COVID, sharing air (masked not) way dangerous people’s hand-washing habits. cautious. unfounded. based tuberculosis spread, tuberculosis particles needed much smaller covid infect you, needed reach interior lungs. getting free will, aren’t holding giving themselves. Vaccines required decades, anything new. States (and individuals, including you!) free follow science. Insisting making vaccinated individuals wear masks situations CDC says they're unnecessary *not following science*. vaccines work exceptionally well. know linked political identity wearing masks pandemic hurt ability judge risks, assessment reality.

Was Texas following science lifted mask capacity restrictions? Absolutely not. Hawaii following science silly outdoor mask mandate (that finally lifted) refusing lift indoor mandates even situations employers verify vaccination status? wildest dreams. Yet argument making would say Hawaii 'following science' Texas reality they've failed opposite directions.  I'm sarcastically agreeing physically forcing people things good society = good thing spiral control. Pregnancy doesnt put colleagues health risk tho company rules something unethical? pandemic raging bad last winter’s surge among unvaccinated.

And many places fully reopened. bad time unvaccinated! People vaccinated care much whether people vaccinated not.  fair political either way. either saying China made it, China covered leak Well guess don’t work then, funny employers don’t hire people. Honestly it’s don’t like things shoved throats. amount manipulation, bribery, shaming, name calling atrocious. demand everyone get vaccinated suspicious am.

Yeah would say everyone. Pre virus saw people leaving restrooms various locations, without washing hands. Ffwd days ago recent. Guy men's room McDonald's. Guy left w/o washing hands.

I doubt one hundred instances either. Antidotal idea talking about. Wats crazy know vaccine safe getting vaccine hassle proves part agenda. that’s kinda creepy cos virus kills people big difference outrage 9/11 favor authoritarian security measures people anti-mask

The 9/11 security measures became part life wanted level control controlled federal state governments 7+ years afterwards everything became “normal” 

Most current administrations US following science there’s reason think vaccine proof security measures stay. Especially big chunk country refusing obey first place Fuck sucks Vaccination status protected class.

I love people get twisted “medical history.” Nobody’s asking you’ve cancer. 

Knowing whether vaccinated contagious, highly deadly disease issue affects everybody around you.   Can't fired miss day work? slightly different strategy Canada strongly holding giving 2nd doses (currently 5% population). UK, moving age groups still, also reached 36% 2nd doses. 

Essentially, UK changed it’s tact mid stream trying get second doses ahead Canada respect. Canada UK roughly % total population “at least one dose” 56% MS similar, 15 years ago people NMO misdiagnosed given MS drugs worsen prognosis (and drastically shorten life expectancy). It’s considered pretty new disease. way onset happened, I’m even cleared get flu shot. I’m glad brother able get vaccinated! data demyelinating disease patients issues, likely I’ll able get year so!  flu shot FDA approved … that’s difference LAWS prevent . employer asks card give you. People hand fake one see fast they'll fired want. Southwest announced policies latest assault captured widely watched video showed woman punching flight attendant face. nothing though, surely hit 70% age group start opening lower brackets since need 70% coverage hit herd immunity.

I agree cases numbers relevant anymore. Throwing experience here. first dose, arm sore eleven days, even sore enough warrant pain reliever. second dose sore 24 hours. know affects people differently, mine nothing much. HIPPA doesn’t apply volunteer medical history them. keep private anybody else you’re protected using within company. Yeah, keep telling that… that’s exactly telling us. Lol. Gotcha. following science cdc local authorities decide keep masks order abide cdc mandate ensure unvaccinated masked up, even vaccinated don’t need them. safe one group done whole two different things cdc recognizes that. don’t. 

Is cdc following science requires masking everyone mass transit? you, following science means vaccinated need wear masks, that’s false goes decision safety vaccinated. RNA viruses frequently demonstrate recombination 2 parent strains host. meant forced vaccines... 
whether want one, government makes look like they’re ones forcing allowing travel, work, basic freedom bans unvaccinated people. Yes, easy go walk understand people missing commute. need define day time away home/office order switch off, it! Log go walk/run/drive/whatever hell like.

One biggest advantages WFH control day. I'm certainly enjoying walking around parks/the touristic city centre much enjoyed squeezing onto train sitting traffic jam. 

I never repeat daily commute quit job wanted go back. It’s ok take time. Everyone go pace. middle pandemic disproportionately affects black brown people. cannot see wearing personnel protective equipment dangerous racist, beyond help. obesity does… smoking does… sedentary lifestyle, dietary habits, age, race, sex.. risk factors lifespan health.. discriminate too? diabetic, employer right mandate diet habits…? It’s something consider. probably left Martenführer. real world examples slippery slope practice, look US domestic spying military-industrial complex. Neither one signs downsizing even slowing. Way less worried confusion exploiting confusion knowing noncompliance Except you’re violating bodily autonomy infecting virus guess sue now

Shouldn't gotten vaccinated? gave something control accepting, got body thus violating bodily autonomy. True! Many people acting though previous infection provides zero protection, repeated studies analyses show generally 80-90% protection range. line protection one gets vaccinated (again, speaking generally, across various vaccines), make sense, also lines various evidence immune response one gets infection+shot equivalent never-infected person gets shot+second shot booster.  70% adults definitely nowhere near herd immunity something infectious coronavirus, that's sure. Dunno many people seem think 70% adults 70% population.

Please provide evidence support statement. Hope find work that.

Why would hope that? appreciate you- hope able get sooner rather later.  Considering wife got sick time, believe vaccinated. He'd likely fine was. Vaccines widely available area. Supply outpaced demand 30% adults fully vaxxed. judging someone's contribution work based whether want take vaccine not? can't serious...? like take this. People vaccinated protected potentially not-yet-immune. Saying way vaccination path immunity. yes, you’re safe, it’s fair look others say “your call; mine”.  want big authoritarian companies answer multiple shareholders trample individual rights? 

Capitalist pig. don’t think letting corporations make call.

Thankfully can’t don’t. However thankfully don’t hire aren’t vaccinated. I’m saying won’t get vaccinated. able reasonable discussion using basic logic without making accusations me? yet give answer question sure long term side effects Covid vaccines? right job

Lol. say conflicts agenda. figure someday, buddy. Canada work way verify vaccinations, though. portion people US get make fake credential, lie form, whatever required get want. feel bad acknowledge responsibility possible consequences. They've family, friends, neighbors whole time even blink thought larger scale get want. Alot people need lose weight get govt force treadmill Goodie wife idea. hand people crisp new hundred-dollar bill get first shot, couple get second shot. would solve vaccination problem, also save ton money long run. Sounds like easy money.   people need yes regards last sentence, get it, imho social signal, NPI (non-pharmacological intervention), nothing nothing less. Wearing mask COVID-19 never supposed social signal, help control virus, somewhere along way politics (which abhor) societal perceptions adopted masking.

I use Social Media (other reddit someone else told reddit Social Media, would say use Social Media all), thus see Facebook groups etc. me, worry others antivaxx fringe groups, radar. anyone else little disappointed lack ""vaccinated privilege""?

Everywhere either ""you wear mask vaccinated"" literally there's way tell means wear mask.

Or, matter vaccinated still put mask walk door table theater.

I glad got vaccinated potentially others protection. want full normal lol extra doses, would certainly make sense that. border open would benefit sides responses here:  people can’t go camping middle woods outside it’s proven virus hardly spreads. instead? Stay home invite people parties instead probably. 



So dumb. think insurance companies mandate it, what's plan?  suspicion right Canada negotiating opening border quicker U.S. sends doses hurry second doses. one said states. Im sorry hear went that. would immensely helpful western governments (I'm looking UK) take swift action, educate populace appropriately.

I feel lot hesitation due 'dont disrupt sleeping capitalist giant!' that's politics I'll shut mouth :)  study required everyone wear N95 mask. headline pretty misleading without important piece information.

The study also required everyone take rapid antigen test came clean allowed concert.

The headline really misleading. reads ""Researchers held experimental indoor concert Spain social distancing. one contracted covid."" gives impression social distancing useful.

A better headline would ""Researchers held experimental indoor concert Spain social distancing safety measures taken instead. one contracted covid.""   one going get dishonorably discharged declining medical treatment. Quoting MCM, ""A dishonorable discharge reserved separated conditions dishonor, convicted offenses usually recognized civilian jurisdictions felo­nies, offenses military nature requiring severe punishment.""

No matter feel importance public health measures, failure get vaccinated usually recognized felony civilian jurisdictions. I'm confused saying.
Are suggesting vaccines deemed ""expired"" current conditions 3-6 months may infact expired may actually expire 2.5 years hit 3 year mark?
If that's case absolutely think waste distribute areas needed. point pandemic think biggest threat mutation dodge way vaccine immunizes ridding world covid hotspots asap best solution.
But point I'm depth would need definite answer vaccines expire thinking further. nothing Canada, Canada well comes vaccines, don’t give Canada fine. countries south desperate need vaccines, many Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, wherever look. give away vaccine specifically countries absolutely need family member whose entire family got except them. lived house one family member taking care everyone sick.they never teasted positive get symptoms. Open everything w/o restrictions. thing covid never eradicated, soo sooner later unvacinnated people get die cuz 'genius' people don´t want get vaccine  It’s letting upvote post. realize Hong Kong anti-vax problem well comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Live life fullest make facts suit narrative. still real people's lives talking about. doctor ? reason TB jab is. stop spread infection save lives. saying though, short dismissive discussion topic last 3 episodes. almost entirely ""lab leak"" theory, many many guests done actual boots ground questioning research subject, pretty detailed reasoning, including facts ""impossible prove negative"", ""nothing 100% impossible"".  Brainwashed believing science?

Everybody NHS TB jab others already work different?

Don’t like understand science opinion shouldn’t working healthcare industry anyway. Yeah that's critical information. fun anywhere wear mask, wear required places entertainment. Great tolerate masks go ahead it, ""normal"". like math lets math. takes anywhere 3-6 months vaccines go bad. People made case goes 3 years governments require proof now, vaccine deemed ""expired"" 3-6 months old. means older ones remained unused. math one specific city(although talking whole country) looks like adds going change soon. started getting expired, give time. always, cant see 5 minutes ahead you. Smh semesters uni expert now. Thats it, aint replying anymore. Think bit next time. Bye. nusing along time ago. required certain vaccines tb tests done. Seriously science medical based industry. Wth wrong you?  I'm saying fill single use syringes, using vials. get one free getting shot.  think failed that. endangering vaccine available everyone take voluntarily? Rest peace:( hope family find peace. may misunderstood. current bottleneck manufacturing ""how many doses"" rather ""how many vials"". one-dose vial increases complexity (more SKUs) return. 

The stuff goes vials plentiful (relatively speaking). One bioreactor create millions vaccine doses worth vaccine 30-40 days, dozens dozens bioreactors across plants. sterile vials machines fill vials constraint.

All turning 10 potential doses 1 potential dose. vial constraint, doses/materials. ""freed up"" 9 doses go elsewhere.  I’ve found Dr. Daniel Griffin’s clinical updates informative, since beginning. However, podcast biased lab leak theory; give serious consideration it. suspect agenda, however still great info. tired brain meant lol wrote 1 made sound confusing. mistake corporations (i.e. CEOs) U.S. government. simple.

Any advice? attend send another appointment future?  Honestly, why? industry in? Anyone thinks 99.6% bad usage rate clearly child still school. breakthrough infection data great, also completely wrong. CDC admitted much stopped trying track non-hospitalized breakthrough cases end April. tacit acknowledgement able get reporting needed order actually track breakthrough cases. 

Breakthrough cases massively undercounted non-test bias (""I got vaccinated, must COVID"") under-reporting bias (test sites typically ask vaccinated, state DPH clearinghouse testing either). Breakthrough reporting entirely voluntary large providers participating. 

Breakthrough risk reported also bad metric overall constantly changing metric (over duration? many person-days? what's community case load?). vaccine efficacy measured.. efficacy statistics. know ""about 95%"". 

This meant ""the sky falling post"". vaccinated 60+ severely immunocompromised, risk death reached absolutely trivially low proportions point background noise. evidenced-based articulating risk efficacy, stupid claims like ""99% efficacy"" "".01% breakthrough cases"" counterproductive dialogue.

But problem policy makers Western world (and elsewhere, assume) still listening it’s authoritative body.

Melbourne's lockdown five cases. surprised Guangzhou (or suburbs we're read article) locking 20 cases.

There's also much less emphasis masks compared US. started wearing public transport June, never worn outside. ""This would include widespread mask use end people serving restaurants cafes."" I'm disagreeing making comments based article quote celebrate going enjoy fresh air instead polluting it.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* made claim. think reasonable one compared almost anywhere world similar situation. think it’s protecting others, feeling safe. work puts ass automatic mandatory 2 week leave covid like symptom even like negative covid test day 1.so understand fear  hard make claims CDC exact opposite stance (removing mask mandates fully vaccinated)  big deal sounds? got sense industry everyone really timid want test balloon special-interest-backed discrimination lawsuit vaccines. employers instead fall back reliance EEOC, could enormous. nearly effective increased ventilation outside...it would nice part messaging point is, know, actually preventing people catching thing. concerning? know take 10-15 years complete required clinical trials drug approved? really lucky might take year more, almost never happens. Pick another stupid argument Well got worried vitamins. should, still wear mask public. care received vacation yet. Also, want anyone thinking I'm G.O.P. supporter. Ok saying figure would 0 someone else? saying merely less.. much less? apparently certain medication. heard plenty scenarios able take vaccine. And? Moving away capitalism idea anyone collective workers owning company first place. Captive audience. living rock year? Like, following sub still know? Yes exactly CDC guidance, results Good know. already feeling quite high, phrased ""probably already well past 500 million"". look he's talking really restrictions. He's saying still need lot testing, tracing isolating, lockdowns restrictive measures. think ranked voting might least slow looming collapse.  country seeing around half level deaths since vaccination program began compared US (per Capita). seeing 2 3 times many cases US per Capita. something right (low deaths) also something wrong (high cases) country compared US. guess would using scarce vaccines efficiently US. Here, managed get vulnerable (like seniors people comorbidities) vaccinated quickly limited supply importantly, get much higher vaccination rate within group. hand, death less vaccines overall compared US, still third wave terms cases (but deaths). 

Now, everything going well luckily. given around 53 doses per 100 people. reaching lower 40's terms age groups around 48% adults least partially vaccinated. seems least partially vaccinated 85% early/mid July. Vaccination readiness adult population around 85 90%. that, vaccinations teens start. Deaths (were already low, even lower), cases, hospital/ICU occupancy dropping quickly. Reproduction number sitting around 0.8 now. letting go restrictions months now, coming weeks accelerate even further. going well.

My country terms vaccinations similar rest EU, one worst terms cases, one best terms deaths (and country something fishy numbers undercounts deaths excessively, average). EU-US better comparison (just wanted throw country, know about, not). looked OWiD figures, deaths EU lower US per capita trend downward EU much steeper US. Cases bit higher EU, similar now, downward trend EU much steeper US. Free country, want. moron let 100,000s thousands Americans needlessly die 100M doses 5 days. pretty impressive speed within China. Projected hit 85% end year.    Fuck shit China administered 100M doses within mainland China last 5 days total exceeded 600M -- excluding export. Maybe people live megacities eat bushmeat? Europeans can't even enter US... exactly would work? company full employees don’t work make money, people sitting building anything… would remedy that? Dissolve company lose business?  It’s almost like people different tolerance levels towards certain things life. concept right? Well best NZ, universe *mandatory* restrictions work 3-5 years thing low rate transmission, happen since small proportion get seriously ill. increases enough, small amount becomes much bigger. Yeah, couple friends hesitant parents, they're anxious anti-vaxx.

Which, guess understandable. I've pfizered up, sorta see someone would want wait extra month two. Unless I'm missing something. Taiwan agreed drop ""country"", deal still fell through. No, i'm liberal thinks everything racist. think odd crying perceived equality etc, think would foresight put regards underserved communities.

After reading EEOC's exact statements this, measures built prevent disproportionate populations affected. lol related all? company requires something gets seriously hurt open thousands millions damages I'm exactly sure saying, people countries keep CDC guidance. everyone know, I'm one who's aware it. We'll wait authorities recommend it. companies though? federal/state level get with. fucking implement way verify whether someone actually vaccinated not. even ""force"" people get it. make nearly impossible live decent life without see people get eventually. Governor Texas literally went TV height pandemic told citizens needed put risk going back public spaces w/o vaccine die economy. 100 years ""Southern Supremacy"" misguided ""personal freedoms"" rhetoric, cultivated political philosophy selfishness, ignorance part entire country, isolationist policy would make post WW1 Americans blush.

Now got Alabama heart South w/ barely blue enclave speak of, institutional unwillingness face reality. That's sane person against. person said ""in particular case"" THIS, going get people hurt US via violence hurt SARS-cov-2.

Those would stand behind stand behind virtue, freedom. ready people sacrifice freedom. Looking forward court case Indian variant doubled UK despite high vaccination rates don’t olympics Japan?? took implemented, become clear they're one important measures. Compared others like staying home, always outside, increased ventilation, they're simple implement low cost. kind condition? Allergies something? never heard vaccine everyone get it. do, it’s effective small number folks.

Clearly understand heard immunity ideally could eliminate disease

Or virus shutting supporting plague enthusiasts

Should stop abortion next ? want take away everyone's right choose 🤣 I’m leaving job next month going back. volume work isnt cant bring sit office 8hrs two hours work anymore. “be present” “there needed” waste time. nice able actually get things done around house instead sitting around day thinking else needs done home, it’s far difficult separation someone pisses work you’re home.  illiterate, willfully reading reasons given thread? That's 0.34% many. :( Even single wasted dose tragedy. Thousands them, though? That's terrible inefficiency time plague. Yeah get sorts licenses revoked Actually not,stadiums full maskles people, thats misinformation. Pfizer 12+.

Others 18+ whatever anyone wants. Though tend push moderna, good 12 hours punctured instead 6 others. IMO, bug likely infected worker Wuhan lab, ... ""That escalated quickly!"" Establishing genuine international cooperation standards respect research labs would go long way. But, given Human Nature, think that's ever going happen. Ya, we're definitely herd immunity numbers. glad finally looking light end tunnel. You’re making misinformation. Nice Covid 100% death rate. That's insanity point. Pfizer 6. 

Moderna 10-15 depending NDC.

Janssen 5. 50% network nodes everyone else distancing. 

Bahahahano. know there's still weeks til final open-up, seems caution 75% thrown wind already.

Plus, ground zero Indian variant (British Indian communities) tend larger, more-crowded multigenerational households UK average.

There's plenty explain spike purely ""contagious supervariant"". And, course, comment downvoted. Pfizer 14 days frozen normal freezer temps 30 days fridge.

Moderna 30 days fridge.

Janssen fridge expires (7/1) employer enter date received shot(s internal form. Reception look confirmation amd gives sticker badge badges required enforced well. enter date shots, agree volunteering information sign truthful. I'm sure got caught lying could/would fired. Win/win me. see what's enjoyable?  saw something...and may state level...but made asking vaccinations HIPAA note charge ordering? Oh you’ve *definitely* demonstrated you’re baby /s   Let say this, maybe... let also say every time seem hope herd immunity another wave happens. Even places Italy huge seroprevalence advantages pretty bad subsequent outbreaks. Cases drop cliff every surge.  question enough fend another 6 months line? Maybe natural infection plus’s high infection rate may enough.  maybe not. go ‘total lockdown’ two weeks Tuesday amid COVID-19 surge. Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore also seeing surge cases Indonesian numbers rise despite low testing.  limited income much worse test positive miss two weeks work.

This true actually. sucks preferable work day two feeling sick vaccine get covid deal weeks able work, mention possibility getting hospitalized could result huge financial burden. sympathy people can't get work

On level, people misled thinking side effects bad, every year get sick work that, appointments make, etc.. Vaccines offered nearly around clock live city. choosing get vaccinated.   It’s click bait. Exposure 13th...tested almost daily negative. showed symptoms 25 tested positive 27. 

Technically that’s 14 days testing positive. likely tested 25th would positive. 12 days within normal range exposure developing enough viral load test positive. 

Not sure using antigen pcr testing. go ‘total lockdown’ two weeks Tuesday amid COVID-19 surge. Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore also seeing surge cases Indonesian numbers rise despite low testing. antibodies infection too! know defrost go bad? stay fridge long period time? Darwinism thing I’m getting vaccinated kinda strong arm move damn. vial 5 doses right? Yeah that’s gonna dawg. dude crying business failing cant find anyone work blame President.

No dipshit, made stupid dangerous choices based conspiracy theories trying punish people right thing.

Go hell. neighborhood handyman stopped bothering mask, also vaccinate, despite talking neighbors died covid.

People plain short sighted. 1. way phrased it, clear certain estimate.

So based on. beginning May, EU delivered around 200 million within EU 200 million exported. two figures following quite closely since beginning.

Considering well 260 million vaccines delivered EU now, almost produced (fill finished) EU, estimate around number exported, gives number million doses produced. China, quite similar story (only rising quite significantly administered doses recently, know effect exports). feeling now? Since people like big people rebelling businesses governments overstepping bounds, maybe bunch different people go there, get extra charges heck sue see happens. I’m sure lawyers could piece together reasoning behind suit. Let 25 lawsuits happening simultaneously. curious, particular order vaccine use first? order got let people choose best way get free press restaurant--- good goofy! one anti vax here.. it’s anti covid longer term testing vax.

Everyone got vaccines around decades took years certify. Wait two weeks data interesting. country’s politicians younger healthiests population. aren’t dying rates countries. It’s suggesting many people age groups die it’s still huge number comparison parliaments politicians dying change things country run  It’s definitely worse get sick miss days/weeks work lots people terrible calculating risk assume won’t happen them. I’m qualified comment this, but…

Are ignoring CDC, reading lines?

I think CDC recommendations healthiest precautions think we’ll go along with, they’d actually recommend thought we’d listen. trying say thread got downvoted.  make change swine flu... someome decided dismantle progress appoint completely unqualified family member run response team Ya found COVID WMDs everyone freeand enjoying democracy 🙄 good idea emerged and...

THERE NOTHING STOP HAPPENING case US, UK, Israel good amount immunity acquired infection. none New Zealand. Yep. I've pleasantly surprised well LA peeps keeping masks public even recent CDC/CA recommendations. haven’t masked holiday friends family yet...

They mean public, right? OSHA says good luck that. Excellent analysis. I’ll admit - surprised first saw Pfizer data December: 30,000 participants across arms, fewer 200 cases deaths. trials conducted significant community spread. Moderna adolescent (12-17 yo) trial reported 4 cases 3,000 subjects, none severe deaths.

The vaccines effective, think also learned benefit highest old infirm (who unlikely clinical trials, therefore underestimate ARR). User name checks  Ok, getting weird. posted opinion confirmation bias. corrected facts. EU bought roughly equal amounts BioNTech, AstraZeneca, CureVac, Sanofi-GSK less Moderna vaccine. EU primary bet. people know talking constantly shouting that. done discussion... Agreed, I’ll take $75. That’s grocery money. don’t know anyone talks free $75 could save 18,500 people. wouldn’t call many lives small. Mine requires vaccinations. require photos such, various methods validate eligibility. said, lowest paid person makes $50,000/year, assume coworkers intelligent enough lie get vaccinated. Near us places vaccinating weekend long. state run sites local pharmacies. in-laws got shots Sunday afternoon. That’s good know! Fortunately I’m vaccinated, didn’t realize mRNA vaccines safe immunocompromised individuals! Even come lab still much possible could face another one pandemics wild born virus climate change.

We might end better is. People make meaningful changes might finally get ass. It’s long weekend UK too. even people (per capita) vaccinated US. Lower cases too. Yet despite that, end mask mandate sight 🙁 get it. time finish vaccinating 65+ year olds, 12-15 year olds eligible current rate. Checked reviews petri dish right, there's lot folks going there. Lol mean wear mask time anyway work...so prefer wearing mask. I’m appalled let ppl breathe air before. highly debatable. company's guideline cannot violate law (e.g. anything discriminates race).

Something related health involves needles going body? Highly debatable... minefield lawsuits. continue follow guidelines previously declared US government. work community college. return working remotely August. care vaccinated not—you simply must return. That’s likely true J&amp;J vaccine, contains live virus, it’s case mRNA vaccines, like Moderna Pfizer vaccines. you’re immunocompromised speak doctor instead assuming can’t get it. Immunocompromised people especially likely benefit, offers level protection increased risk getting COVID.  Sweet virus bdsm role play It’s actually way keep cdc guidance since say unvaccinated need remain masked. Two ways this:

1. Masks everyone. Or

2. Verify vaccinations. 

The honor system doesn’t work it’s going fail follow cdc advice anywhere implemented. also mandate living wage possible agreement came late business factors sunk deal then. seller's market plausible partial deal may go yield competing deal. e.g. country may taken portion BNT could commit delivery time. No, University Illinois.  That’s flu vaccine completely eliminated flu right? Except hasn’t. Covid going us forever regardless vaccine campaign. Natural selection pushes viruses towards transmissible less deadly. Covid going fade background like seasonal flu.

You worry vaccinations status get authoritarian trip telling people bodies. Thank you. Cal Poly SLO? kids it? people going work leaving children home alone? nothing point That's free market work, this, people go there. see production numbers EU China exceeding 500M doses? viruses gone wild There's many people vaccinated many people previously infected kind damage past US. Winter spikes entirely possible within states communities low vaccination rates, going spread everywhere way past. 

Barring large immune escape mutation worst luckily passed US, though lot people continue die needlessly due inadequate vaccination levels certain states. .4% 

But yeah, take shit seriously here. Americana (out door mall) almost everyone wearing mask nice 80 degree day. ones see wearing mask either eating/drinking/ kids playing. know downvoted lol. mean shitty employer give day get vaccine sick would still get vaccine work sick need to. Probably antivaxers want admit it.

I know many people traveled internationally USA (and rich people) get vaccine people literally minutes away sort BS excuses like one.  People immunosuppressed, like people cancer medications It’s hassle. I’ll saliva test happily every morning crash test dummies vaccinated 2-5 years like properly tested vaccines. mask isn’t even inconvenience more. expecting see stat high -- 75% diseases come animals? literally guy smoking outside post office heckling wearing mask day. like “Oh yeah, don’t want catch super COVID.” set like, “nah I’m already vaccinated” got car. started ranting kept drove away lol. Like I’m going take health advice dude smoking outside post office. something people outside Australia understand quarantine enough. systems place catch inevitable leaks.

The lockdown necessary (or atleast be). One Australian state controlled multiple outbreaks without lockdown using contact tracing alone. Thank kind thoughts. allowed screen. process failed screening delay document. eventually told find way go onsite. sometimes arranged hours weekend visits, even option 24/7 medical station chicken plant.... employees report feeling ill, (bitter lol) . prison count room, etc. real enforcement. ones told truth.

I know one site would sit ill employees front air conditioner could pass IR temp scan.

It terrible thing turn co-workers hand couple tickets. terror go. terror might catch going ticket refused.

Jim thought caught clinic, many visits many sites made impossible pinpoint. course places notified potential exposure (another bitter laugh). once...ever....were us notified potential exposure.

My worldview changed... I'm weary hateful people. far behind you. I'm saying health decisions protected too. Personal rights apply even cost community whole. 

Also people cannot take vaccine health reasons. forced disclose health conditions?

Asking people something may cause long term harm allowed. long term effects tested, I'd happy required. now, healthcare positions, vaccinations required part duty care patients heck get cold?

But also... keep private anybody else. means information needs kept secure.  seems accurate Japan, Australians desperately want vaccinated govt taken major steps early pandemic get vaccines early. Unfortunately decisions fallen through. homegrown vaccine abandoned big deal made manufacture AZ Australia fell apart blood clots issue. They've done late deal lots Pfizer doses back line arriving late year. people unhappy federal govt failure get vaccines. 

Where live NZ also rely measures Vietnam, also desperately want vaccines. govt made huge early deals 4 different vaccines last year, buying enough vaccinate population 4 times over. manufacturers slow deliver us. get large supplies Pfizer July. avoid going places public restrooms first place, using there. safe. Oh boy. checked funds Snopes: dare accept money ... checks notes ... ""reader contributions.""

I know ""Politifacf"" is. recorded get shit without id  article Canada. 75 ""racist"" dollars. Get right!  return work date August 2. Back beginning installed plexiglass cubes.

I’ll glad jigsaw puzzle room back though, it’s office home don’t feel like spending time night spend day there. Somehow worryingly popular opinion know many people died 6 months? Well good you. Yeah bothers wear mine kinda enjoy anonymity tbh haha people area still wearing masks want dirty looks either lol go pace Yes, US view. Vaccines racist. I'm thing doing, family vulnerable too. know people rotten people harming one. I'm basing kids risk groups country gotten vaccine, basing statement on? passenger posted video incident told Fox 40 flight attendant provoked fight. Michelle Manner told news station, “Vyvianna said three times, could hear, ‘Get me. Quit touching me. Get hands me.'” Manner know Quinonez. said heard flight attendant “rudely” tell Quinonez travel companions put masks back noses.  unnecessary. first altercation, said going call captain. should’ve stayed back cubby,” Manner told Fox 40. “But came back screaming again. flight attendant continued yell. mean yelling. got point to, we’re like, start videoing this? unprofessional. rude, way handled anything.” also immune lawsuits? think corporations board think   Yeah, work local restaurants fast food shops free food something. I'm glad accept people stood gain lockdowns (or accurately, lose less none). one stands gain waiting allow travel everyone vaccinated (which likely mean 2023 globally lockdown world months end, wait month two let people protected go vacation.

You'd rather travel restrictions remain everyone chance vaccinated twisted sense fairness That's big slap face younger people want take vacation possible problem getting test think talk slaps faces.


And keep talking unfair unvaccinated people higher risk cancel/postpone vacation unvaccinated people, forget one forcing book vacation travel restriction force everyone vaccinated even option go vacation. Nooooooooooooooooooooo

You take away thing flight makes bearable??? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'll take 3rd vaccine $2000 incentive. trial 3rd Moderna booster, probably kill me... Thats exactly get masses go along bullshit pull... Amazing. Let's blame middle income country world's problems, rich countries ones hoarding. top that, US even restricted export raw materials, Time audacity blame India instead.

Wonderful stuff right here! They're largest pandemic, doubt case makes think doses allocated need? clearly holding bunch vaccines case people want vaccinated... thousands people work manufacture goods big tech companies including Samsung, Canon Apple. country's aggressive social distancing policies experience prior epidemics seen effective measures stopping spread. religious events banned nationwide, authorities major cities closed public parks nonessential businesses help stop large gatherings, according AP. going claimable self employed individuals like CARES ACT allowed Sick Leave Family Leave Certain Self-Employed Individuals? New York paid sick leave state mandates employers give 4 hours paid time get shot work missed reaction covered paid sick leave.  Nice! decent portion people 20s get even first doses gonna over. Immunocompromised *may* lesser reaction, may not. They've also talking third booster shot people may poor uptake first shots. ok     later turned Lancet letter organized drafted Peter Daszak, president EcoHealth Alliance New York. Daszak’s organization funded coronavirus research Wuhan Institute Virology. SARS2 virus indeed escaped research funded, Daszak would potentially culpable. acute conflict interest declared Lancet’s readers. contrary, letter concluded, “We declare competing interests.”

That guy going offensive tide turning him? I'm shocked. Yeeeeah, really. Says quite bit you. one work feverishly taking signs, putting back furniture, acting like pandemic over. They’re following “you don’t wear mask you’re vaccinated” rule...but know people arent wont getting it. state allowed people get vaccinated last month. told allowed make mandatory, it’s likely enforced.  already shouldn’t trust medicine. someone went entire year torture stupid doctors don’t listen care profits, advocate health yourself. Dentist week wanted fill non cavity tooth due discoloration I’ve years. declined.

Maybe fix broken healthcare system things change. “vaccines” shouldn’t even called that, suspect. going 10 months? Ofc already talking yearly flu/COVID shot. know means $$$$$$$$$$🤑🤑💰💰

Employers mind business. hey, fire don’t get it, I’d imagine go unemployment. Yes, think differences among countries. I’m glad well, friends! GOOD  wish could sort normalize mask wearing general reasons stated father's vulnerability flu things. Agreed. I’m vaccinated think everybody be. don’t like giving employers power demand ANYTHING anybody, honest. Better kick crotch I'd expect Walmart  many ways free market USA lot respectable say ""I know anything Chinese economic policy"".""

I refuted statement posting 2 sources demonstrate am/was correct. You, however, can't add anything substance instead respond comments like typical jake paul follower. sith deal absolutes. Note India producing them. oversea cheap produce plants India say vaccines going unless buys them. statement India largest producer misleading. Doctors quite literally ones saying continue wear mask due asymptomatic passing disease. Literally. Doctors. Like entire board directors doctors. hospital. 

So...wut? knew virus was, Black Plague already wiped Native Americans. pretty much whatever want pharmacy without prescription

And pay doctor get forged perception I'm India even bother ask it

E.g. got cold? Go pharmacy get antibiotics. Got covid? Go grab steroids Unlikely that’s has. places opening up, regular old colds back, though. He’s probably caught one those, something pollinating nearby making sniffly. wouldn’t worry unless one gets really sick. Well get vaccine weekends days dont work. run drives constantly people going. think guidance CDC taken seriously trust make right decision mask mandates begin relieved. really wanna wear mask protect care enough protect themselves. hosts virus circulate between, mutate time, vaccine boosters we’re gonna need keep shit bay. need everyone vaccinated get. polls far 90% population Canada willing get vaccinated surprising. military 85% vaccinated, many offered yet. Well, absolutely vaccinated people 20's, friends first vaccine, I'm due 2nd 4 weeks. siblings even vaccinated youngest 17. 
Its deaths, hospitalisation, chronic health issues strain things put NHS, brilliant service is, struggling parts UK long COVID happened. Sounds like discrimination lawsuit Montana’s Gov passed law saying even Hospitals can’t require vaccination nurses/doctors... I'm yank twat I'd thing. get world's largest manufacturer tag comes from. India vaccinated lower percentage world whole. world wide dose number 1.8 billion India 200 million. China getting close 600 million doses now. Vaccination informed consent without duress.  Go watch stephen colbert

First all, hell anything? second all, trying argue absolutes? fat, angry, american, bad look 2021  reach herd immunity, probably matter then.

But COVID? least much post-COVID pre-COVID. trend continues, takes 30000/10 = 3000 days, 8.22 years, China surpass US daily cases! things change! Get vaccinated  mean? choice require vaccine choice work there? Sounds like everyone free choose I'm saying dont feel fairly compensated required responsibility fool. lazy subordinates.  Yeah, one things very, hard sell people. science behind immune systems Hygiene Hypothesis directly contradicts lifestyles good chunk population, they're likely take info personally. Threat losing job isnt coercive?

The threat losing job incentive.

The statement referring things like offering bonuses vaccination, would nominally okay. However, understanding pursue bonus get vaccinated fired, would okay, due coercive nature. Sensible. God Waiting Room, Express Service extra cost. parents waiting call one hospital. article mentions Manitoba: 

The average number patients COVID-19 treated hospital day dropped 34 per cent since April peak. infection rates still high — particularly Manitoba — hospitalization rates still crisis point. 

But nationally, they're past third wave. Incentive, like ultimatum. I'm vaccinated, I'm protected Covid I'm worried getting sick. decide get vaccinated, that's choice, longer affects me.
Shaming people getting vaccinated disgusting. 
It's also important note cases lack trust government rooted systematic racism, considering people's experience mistrust authority kind tone def. Jobs mandate according EEOC.

EEOC speaks regs EEOC's purview. Even that's opinion EEOC necessarily court going interpret it. jobs going risk lawsuit full approval coming pipeline soon. way emergency authorizations used past (precedent) makes unlikely mandates would withstand courts. can't even mandate military EUA without basically major national security emergency.   That's true lot time something vaccines different. immunosuppressed cousin bone marrow transplant 10 years ago got shots. roommate's mom currently cancer undergoing chemo got shots. pretend know Covid shot different is. US we're pretending over. See works out. Distributing large sum money select people always nonsense. Given companies already fully legally able U.S. - e.g. require pee cup test urine drugs - think prediction likely pan out. countless breached treaties, bloody relocations, failures enforce crimes natives, destroying lands make room oil pipelines later poison water... really come process very, fast tracked mRNA vaccines. technology proven out, viruses, could vaccines arms within month two. Lock downs would unnecessary. short term border closures would likely enough vaccine prepared.  trying say? Work less, expense staff wellbeing?

I guess, ""stick Frontline worker"". I'm sorry, I'm selfish. must big fan Ayn Rand.   weird thing EEOC meant protect employees discriminated workplace. 

What lot people don’t realize lot people *physically can’t get vaccine* due disabilities illnesses don’t allow (immunocompromised people, fake “exemptions”). Yet EEOC saying employers right fire employees. missing something?  “underpaid sherpa” 
... Thanks. right. realized referring different thing hitting publish button.  Public health officials collaborate behavioral economists. Medicine + epidemiology + psychology + economics would probably come something effective possible, acceptable population possible, communicated well possible, sustainable. fire reason time

The phrase, ""they fire (almost) whatever want"", implicitly includes ""including reason"". vaccination rates slowing dramatically. need incentivize half country actually get shot, check government would motivate everyone vaccinated yet.  feel strongly every school's requirements vaccines? posts seen Canadian province Manitoba? believe still reporting highest rates COVID-19 North America (for 2 weeks). factor in? Truly God's country.  Yeah also get choose want show. Like said vaccine def agree prove it. I'm also big advocate body choice, someone want get vaccine, that's support decision. 
It's personal decision influenced outside factors. got mine want get sick. could potentially save someone decided get vaccine. 
For sure I'm planning making every situation awkward satisfaction showing passport like, trust people. 48-year-old inmate, Singaporean, tested Covid-19 May 13, May 17, May 19, May 20, May 21, May 23, May seven occasions, test results came back evening May 25, inmate developed fever tested eighth time May time, test result came back positive May 28. Confused even needed said, tbh. Privately-held organizations get decide works premises conditions (subject certain baseline requirements, like non-discrimination, compliance safety regulations, etc., within terms union agreements applicable). Dudes complaint 75 free dollars  assume everyone unmasked unvaccinated selfish know lot people reaction. don’t think peer pressure stop wearing masks perception unmasked people unvaccinated goes away. demand pillars salt. There’s caveats involved.. nothing set stone yet. There’s currently 85 bills submitted block mandate. mandate meet certain criteria involved comply “other laws” article says. That’s dangerously vague. laws include liability issues. Small companies may care JP Morgan much lose god forbid something wrong vaccines. see policy exclusions commercial insurance coverage head already. Large corporations mandate, they’re smart to. you’re excusing behavior normalizing it. It’s real game changer accept evil corporations power us, get that. real problem already rigged system inevitably used us. 

Could company claim employees *must* exercise set number minutes week it’s good (and coincidentally save company millions health insurance sick day lost productivity)? It’s perfect analogy, guarantee smart lawyers already looking regulations ways make clients profitable expense workers. Notice guidance says employers won’t liable effects required COVID vaccinations. make rule could potentially cause illness, disability, death, bear responsibility? 

I don’t want Guy; unfortunately life experience taught world gets complicated widespread misery apparent. might peaceful time terms large scale physical wars clearly culture wars happening moment giving power corporations aiding abetting enemy. Don’t sell fellow 99%, always comes back around you. I’ll take $75 take free vaccine please. I’ve both. get $150? Tell we’re going ensure follow cdc advice unvaccinated remain masked. see violates anything cdc said maybe you’ll get it. 

Otherwise really don’t care guidance obviously selfishly wanting wear mask. That’s happened Polio vaccine, eventually became mandatory nation able basically rid country Poliovirus.  Wrong Thanks this. topic article commenting on? think looking others are. looking individual person basis, others looking regional community spread basis. even one non-vaccinated person wandering around grocery store (for example) huge problem, terms community spread. lot children vaccinated, could easily exposed, spread around home daycare children. Different countries looking differently, variants coming, sure that, undeniably huge unknown. may go well, wearing masks point leaving room kind community spread problems occur. That’s typical Republican answer, make rules laws fit consider right way American, preconceived notions challenged answer always don’t like leave go somewhere else.... sad found one referring to. clear, I'm defending WHO. clearly fucked up. I'm giving possible reason why. Unironically yes. Employers used obligated *train* employees paying them. They've outsourced employee's responsibility employee's dime. am, almost everyone wearing masks. people hear talking excited end mandates people local Facebook groups aggressively wearing masks despite vaccinated. don’t think know one person IRL goes places unmasked.  gives shit? Mcdonalds nutrition facts online, people know they're getting. Nobody forced eat unhealthy choose, because, eating processed food McDonald's spread air. need wear mask around fat ass co-workers fear becoming fat ass myself, eat healthy want. again, would employer mandate diet habits, related airborne contagious virus? Nothing listed contagious all. Weird never heard peep single issue, like drug testing Employers able set terms employment all. power disproportionate relationship entire concept employment, really able fire employees general, needs go. also allowed require those. Ok Yeah fast food easy come easy go mean, yes is. it’s easiest thing world free much stopping getting allergies. True, that's look last year everyone practically behaving like normal. restrictions large gatherings, millions people traveling country.

When cases pop various cities look mass testing do, along releasing details cases contact trace ease.

So, yeah look do. Lmao bodily autonomy fucking reach  I’m pretty sure article saying employers mandate COVID vaccine. Also younger age groups, hang people younger age groups. despite 50% population immunised, younger people people interact immunised, spread within subset people affected much vaccinations older people. *slides home bleach suppository* sherpa climb mountain someone else? California like 80% vaccinated though, totally surprising AZ lower. moved back CA AZ two months ago. whole state never took seriously, maybe weeks. soon summer rolled around last year, things basically back normal except masks. imagine part reason outdoor dining isn’t option it’s consistently 100 degrees like 5 months year. assume use J&amp;J stuff like that? same. think last year constant mask wearing drought. year mask free ideal mild winter.

I think I'm slightly sensitized pollen higher. Yeah convenient way say “we’re following CDC guidance” effectively keeping mandate nobody going bother checking cards. hope ends soon. knows. Employers cannot mandate shot approved FDA. liability standpoint alone it’s unimaginable risk. vaccine happens fail long term side effects.. point.. ramifications would devastating. suggest mandate masks vaccinated mandate “experimental” shot wrong. got doses already, voluntarily. Sucks doesn’t it? wanted celebrate little! Doubt.  Ah, realize required commercial relationships. changed comment. Yeah wear everyday driving bus like wear time don’t care doesn’t bother all. common person doesn’t wear everyday  Yeah how’s government boot taste? least giant companies obvious fucking average citizen I’d rather exception religion. There’s reasonable justification religious exception. Yikes. Thank fuck I'm self employed. Maybe increase lab security That's works dude.  target almost masked customers. new guidance first came out, lot employees unmasked. week later masked again. suspect people complained management uncomfortable.  posted picture weeks worth profits kroger first couple weeks covid internal investigator find fired week later. 

My store alone made 100% profit start covid year prior. *1 million dollars* one week instead usual 500k store. tons stores state alone better us least similar sales. 

All company give us $25 dollar store credit bonus. backlash finally gave *one time bonus* 75 dollars part time workers 125 dollar bonus full timers. 


That it. company still making INSANE profits, putting workers awful conditions, people getting sick/dying ending understaffed departments working remaining people death. 

I friend working 60-80 hours week department. people either constantly getting sick new people quitting work conditions. 

Kroger taking profits instead making stores safer employees customers making even million dollar bonuses instead. hope Kroger burns down. 

If anyone wants picture profits took let know. Even though insane important info one wants touch news stations. wonder why. America, yes. Hope retirement remember 50 hour weeks like everyone remembers family time. Congrats Assuming continues, next week there’ll 6000 variant cases. week 12,000. Approaching million August. Fortunately every adult supposed vaccinated then. US may luck this, hope do, read many comments, people seem think over. think ""just get vaccinated return normal""........and might work variants, huge unknown. variants unknown, logical thing point everything possible get rates low possible, quickly possible.....get community spread absolute minimum asap. think Canada US per capita first vaccinations, possibly also full vaccinations, Canada staying masks social distancing, good reason. Israel way ahead Canada vaccinations, also staying masks. 

There definitely two schools thought this. hope US ruin progress made. defined group people naturally immune COVID. Reaction mean immunity. unvaccinated concerned catching covid, probably get vaccine. agree. risks zoonotic disease laboratory accidents known *decades.* problem understand diseases come from, risks ignored. doesn’t make disaster Covid response including botched vaccine rollout less joke. Giving away 80 million doses weird definition hoarding...  source credible Telegraph Sun UK. Can't believe allowed source sub.  thought already knew? 

* False beliefs alternative medicine caused ingesting infected animals
* confusion denial governments - admitting ""weaknesses"" management preparedness 
* Misinformation anything worry - ""it's flu"".
* Toxic media social media coverage
* Believing conspiracies instead truth, refusing contribute efforts stop spread Also 31 - Thursday - also sore arm :) True. also care need lower virus circulation. need high number vaccinated people.

As risk themselves, guess don’t care people willfully ignorant, still feel need fight disinformation. far know, BioNTech, Moderna, J&amp;J Janssen working weaponized virus research. Yes, weaponzied research one way approach it, certainly way. It’s story that’s used justify research freedom happened reality. 

And, I’m specifically pointing weaponizing research, virus research. Backing up, dating apps like Bumble, I've seen profiles nurses say want someone antivax wear mask.  I'm vaccinated, I'm protected Covid

That's works. much likely protected COVID, 100%.

Efficacy calculated comparison non-vaccinated control group. 

95% efficacy means every 20 unvaccinated people would gotten symptomatic COVID, instead 1 vaccinated person would get symptomatic COVID.

For J&amp;J certain strains, numbers like 4-1 instead. 

So still better long, concentrated contact virus. ‘Numbers exaggerated greatly’

Right... you’re one you... someone lives Alabama tell need way out, already while. took hard road, I'm sure, think half people caught covid. numbers low months now. corona virus around years? old disinfectant says protects corona.  UK May 17th.. glad able leave. Even zero Covid strategy downsides Lemme ask something... get normal yearly Flu shots? whole reason elimination covid possible countries 5 day incubation period. gives contact tracers time find exposed isolate they're infectious.

Isn't whole deal COVID spread even carrier asymptomatic/presymptomatic? Infected people contagious 1-2 days onset symptoms. really troublesome. hospital staff act like this, end corona madness.

Can please help getting back normal life?

So sick lockdowns, zoom meetings, able visit family. Surgeon General said stop buying masks 'they work', Fauci said see reason public wear time. Nobody *required* point, would good idea, since strengthen immunity. First search google shows 134M people fully vaccinated stop think said? Colds definitely circulating normal life opening back up. you’re vaccinated, almost certainly cold. Feel better soon. really can't compare two. pfizer moderna tested guy said US ""low point"". J&amp;J tested Brazil South Africa start 2nd wave, UK, Manaus SA variants, SA people took part test mainly made people HIV positive. 65% effective conditions pretty darn good. Bush actually made pandemic response team reading book Spanish flu. Obama expanded good bit swine flu. Entirely possible. covid continue hit unvaccinated population heavily. Well see israel. covid restrictions ending next month Thank I'm Texas article clearly Australian (and Oceana flare), yes feel sorry too. Aluminium? Yeah *really* bad study Indian scientists. That's one Ding-Feigl shouted engineered HIV viruses (refuted) SARS lab leak Beijing forgot mention viral lab leaks occur year. think they're delusional think stop next pandemic. Even science solid, politics stupidity prevent significant improvement next pandemic identified managed.

The thing shortened pandemic millions dollars thrown developing vaccine quickly. searched didn’t see posted, think must been? Sorry repost. Professor Racaniello’s pick week latest TWiV. literally highlighted **OVER** next six weeks. Meaning actively shipping them. 80 million doses vaccine going multiple countries certain refrigeration criteria going easily shipped like 2 days. state tribes 7% population believe they're around 28% covid deaths. allowed vaccinated 1A result believe high rates vaccine compliance. one question is, belong group reason ever trust US government, decide vaccine actually safe? one groups people see questioning absolute legitimacy, especially got bumped front line shots rolling out. 30% population refuse vaccinate, virus around mutate.

We live constantly vaccinate new strains Industries disengaging China (intel spending billions build plants USA Europe, example)

I also GP regularly see. Yeah don’t much hope. Jeez, comments sure mixed bag. people unvaccinated likely people take seriously back then/ever either. [According past 14 days hospitalizations 18%.

Indeed, not, claim said able follow science. Tell that’s wrong?

It not, agree statement.

What stated disagree aren’t scientists technically either. Yet follow science.

In context, implies doctors better position understand science nurses.

In reality, absolutely case. That's one seems come with. Ok buddy. get point. Well done Hi, thank asking!
I actually slept almost 10 hours total, mostly successful/restful! Woke feeling well rested headache/almost symptoms. weird red spot forearm nowhere though (it looked like something pinched hard)... doctor look it, said nothing worried about. 

So now, hoping headaches come back enjoying feeling *better* I've felt since February actually! (Been dealing IBS issues) Every hospital I’ve ever worked required proof vaccination every year flu. Definitely honor system. reserved residents particular states. FEDERAL program.

Which state Canada? Yup. I'm pretty big precautionary measures, know outdoors safest place be. people camp 6' apart wear masks communal areas, would probably *more* contain pandemic would something people safely instead taking risks. case, African American, unique (kinda) history justified skepticism regarding medical advances country. Despite caught Covid, I’m looking reality need get vaccinated work. Plus enough time passed people vaccinated feel better it. OSHA: ""If require employees vaccinated condition employment (i.e., work-related reasons), adverse reaction COVID-19 vaccine work-related. adverse reaction recordable new case 29 CFR 1904.6 meets one general recording criteria 29 CFR 1904.7.""

Otherwise, correct vaccines. OSHA: ""If require employees vaccinated condition employment (i.e., work-related reasons), adverse reaction COVID-19 vaccine work-related. adverse reaction recordable new case 29 CFR 1904.6 meets one general recording criteria 29 CFR 1904.7.""   vaccine flu would rather deal cold year wear mask everywhere go. 

But you. Dang guess can't disagree. Definetly misread office national statistics U.K. run blind serological study every week since pandemic began. data came from. Randomised sampling population. robust. argument t/b cell immunity hold water would propose people could develop t/b cell immunity without first generating antibodies. would startling finding. curious, corrupt people whose scientific expertise seem doubt doesn’t agree view ?  ""both sides"" situation obligated state sides are:

Democrats vs Republicans? No.
Liberal vs Conservative? No.
Left vs Right? No.

Evidence based reasoning vs evidence based reasoning? Yeah, go. That's dichotomy sides you.

Lol right job Everyone things now, even repeal mask mandates. cover breathing holes whatever filter find near others, especially strangers unknown status. amazing controversial approach help avoid air-borne infections. Yes. Online I've found Indian variant 50% transmissible and, bit guess, means R rate 4.5.

""Maths minute: ""R nought"" herd immunity | plus.maths.org""  Old people welcome travel care, lose respect do. Lock us 16 months take vacation end? hell thinking? next pandemic help more. wife trying go Amsterdam, Paris London Aug. 10th - 25th. think U.S. travel allowed then? keep checking vaccine rates! (We vaccinated since Feb. NY) teach here. cough vaccine.

Actually “microplasma” doesn’t vaccine, you’re thinking canine influenza bordatella. good news article vaccines appear really working.

The pandemic raging bad last winter’s surge among unvaccinated. drop cases among vaccinated. indicates vaccines working. Note: OSHA specifically — they're still recorded general, way would affect employment Exactly. different basic qr code bar code even. Look back drivers license. contain lot basic data got green card. update vaccines (mmr flu) live country. Also chickenpox haven’t it. demands medical records. hope people got vaccinated won’t need hospitalization would real disaster Understandable. Americans beat rich can't afford $400 emergency. Employment conditions trample individual rights.... Even mostly less vaccinated demographics, spreading efficiently *at all* adults least one shot, half adults fully vaccinated place substantial infection % pretty concerning. work 50% network nodes unavailable everyone else distancing. 

Supporting that, also taking B-117, reliably supplanted ancestor wild type. transmissible again. 

This going problem places low vaccine access uptake. think also are. work area decently high population vaccination rates, although conducted official censes among nurses work with, considering much time spent complaining long hard process made us get shot, I'm pretty sure decent uptake too. pro-vax culture, people chosen get noted absence general discussion complaints - they're ones sitting silently nothing say, think still better areas anti-vaxers loudest try convert others general nonsense. pick slack.

No don’t. making choice to. make opposite choice work regular hours… ask butt plug, say like metal plate a

Can really call enough data FDA approve them? /s every employee eligible FMLA.

You’re right, salaried employees “exempt” status don’t qualify since they’re legally allowed work 5 minutes one day week they’re entitled full pay… Anaphylaxis mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently estimated occur 2.5 11.1 cases per 1 million doses generally get severe allergic reaction second time exposed allergen, advice OP got sound. see reason doubt them. Reportedly “quarantined” actually running around hotel maskless. spread jt other. That’s wave started. 0 We're talking something already risk losing, something never first place. important distinction.   I’m sorry difficult decision comes this. household able fully quarantine year, already pretty bad shape last 6 months, it’s easier wait bit hopes flair-up wouldn’t something couldn’t handle bit better. position, would probably lean strongly toward getting vaccinated. don’t think vaccines unsafe, think cause flair-ups subset people autoimmune conditions, it’s hard know one not. Getting COVID better people conditions, since activates immune system well.

I've always allergies year bad. past two weeks ive stopped im take additional OTC sinus medication addition daily allergy medication (which I've gona ahead amd switched noticed old one working anymore, I've always allergies). 

Anyone else issue? Your's don't. state state considering progress state, vacination percentage said states. 

I'm simply advocating careful, thoughtful, data based view. opposed ""it's everyone! restrictions!"" clearly still need restrictions. Even really wasnt. places basically discarding excess doses any, is/was frontline worker (by comparison itd go someone working office best, though might vulnerable) worked large hospital system. never medical facilty work would remind get vaccinated submit vaccination paperwork. didn’t submit paperwork would require sign declination form force wear mask medical facility reason. wise decision hindsight.

Tha answer obvious; former president cronies knowingly downplayed pandemic keep economy running, especially election approached. Hence talk ""no worse flu"" even Herman Cain tweet [from Great “it looks like virus deadly mainstream media first made be.” think somewhat correct. India certain obligations deliver vaccines party ordered doses.

Whether India legal right stop exports depends contents contract. That’s 0.34% delivered vaccines.

MERS also probably started bats, came Middle East, appeared infect humans via camels rather civets. It’s harder study one, though, since MERS deadly, also pretty terrible human-to-human infection (thankfully) didn’t stick around long enough studied thoroughly.
