0,2021-11-03," I’m pretty well vaccinated area I’m vaccinated myself, biggest concern work holiday events right holidays. don’t want get sick right Christmas! Well crud, apologize.  truth feels like guilt-trip there’s reason. literally ***NOT*** said. Take **does stop** getting COVID Part 2:

Estimation station

Our next step feed numbers machine-learning algorithm called “gradient booster”, order determine combinations variables yielded accurate estimates excess deaths per 100,000 people. method makes predictions based series “decision trees”. instance, one tree might first check test positivity rates given threshold, ask whether number tests per person exceeds different cut-off. might find figures greater benchmarks, excess deaths tend higher model expected asking questions. thus adjusts prediction incrementally upwards. algorithm constructs thousands trees, one detecting new patterns improve forecasts generated “forest” previous ones.

To assess whether model’s estimates accurate, split data ten chunks. One one, set aside single chunk, trained algorithm remaining nine-tenths data, asked model make prediction excess deaths countries allow see. model good job estimating mortality places knew real number not, reasoned would fare similarly well making predictions countries one knows true value.

Our model far perfect. cases, best guess number excess deaths given country given week far high; others far low. Overall, however, model reasonably well-calibrated. Given 100 different examples combinations countries weeks predictions between, say, 0.45 0.55 excess deaths per 100,000 people, might actually low -0.1 others might fact high 1.5. However, average 100 cases generally close 0.5. true levels predicted excess deaths, -0.2 -0.1 per 100,000, 0.75 0.85.

Our algorithm struggled peak direst outbreaks. small handful cases estimated horrifying weekly tolls three excess deaths per 100,000 people, real numbers clustered two three. (You see pattern top right chart above, red line, representing best-fitting trend predicted actual data, dips black 45-degree line represents perfectly calibrated model.) However, severe cases rare barely influence total global estimate. example, model’s current estimate out-of-control outbreak ravaging India still 1.5 excess deaths per 100,000 people per week, putting country comfortably within range forecasts generally target.
Believe not

Our algorithm produces single best guess, “point estimate”, country week. However, central estimates may little value sit near middle vast ranges uncertainty. one example commonly cited statistics classes illustrates, picture poor student given two buckets water, one near boiling, near freezing. best guess temperature was, correctly, comfortable 50° C. However, failing appreciate importance variation surrounding estimate, put one foot each.

To avoid pitfalls, final step calculate ranges within model suggested true answer would lie, varying degrees certainty. used method called “bootstrapping”. Rather merely using full dataset produce single model, created 100 artificial datasets size, first picking countries random, similarly selecting weeks data random chosen country. country week chosen, remove instead left place. result, individual artificial dataset contains many copies certain country-week pairs, whereas others absent entirely.

Next, trained different gradient-boosting model simulated datasets. model contains different set decision trees reflect different patterns relationships variables, reflecting idiosyncrasies specific artificial dataset used create it. turn, model yields slightly different prediction every single country-week combination. excess-death total publish, use model trained actual, complete dataset central estimate, middle 95 50 predictions generated 100 models confidence intervals. bounds reflect ranges within models suggest true value lie, 95% 50% certainty.
Combining all

Our final step combine estimates published data excess deaths. week country true number excess deaths reported, simply use known value; one missing, fill estimate instead. countries, India, use model’s prediction every week; others, America, needed estimate recent week.

This process illustrated chart below, showing data Egypt. extent, estimates move time direction officially recorded covid-19 deaths. However, relationship official estimated deaths varies. periods recorded outbreaks worse, model reckoned undercounting severe well (as suggested available data).

By adding known estimated totals every country every week, compute estimated global total excess deaths due pandemic, uncertainty ranges reflect precision estimates. read model’s conclusions, results imply, please see Briefing.

Covid-19 death tallies

How estimated true death toll pandemic
Dealing potential outcomes, known unknowns, uncertainty

ACADEMIC RESEARCH often seeks answer counter-factual questions. would happened drug administered earlier someone suffering disease? wealth distributed equally is? would occurred revolution failed instead succeeded—or successful one failed? Even quantum physics, cannot observe something happening not: soon open box containing Schrödinger’s cat, animal either alive dead. Yet time scholars make causal claims, implicitly estimating results comparison actually occurred might have, didn’t.

The covid-19 pandemic changed world innumerable ways, immediate tragic consequence loss life. countless research topics, calculating full account disease’s human toll requires estimating answer counter-factual question. many people died number would still perished SARS-CoV-2 never emerged?
Why count them?

The answer question measured using “excess mortality”, gap total number deaths occur reason amount would expected normal circumstances. Excess mortality caused pandemic probably smaller covid-19’s total effect world’s population: reduction number babies born pandemic could well exceed net increase deaths. However, much comprehensive official statistics many people killed disease.

Public-health authorities classify anyone dies within weeks positive covid-19 test covid-19 death. cases, method lead over-counting: people, particularly ones extremely old suffer severe ailments, would died anyway time infected present. often, however, approach leads underestimates. Lots people would still alive today infected covid-19 show official figures, succumbed disease without tested it.

In addition, pandemic indirect effects death rates. Many people treatable medical conditions died receive appropriate health care. Conversely, people survived who, behavioural changes induced covid-19, would died causes like influenza, air pollution car accidents.

These effects quite large, vary country country size direction. According recent data, excess deaths America 7% higher official covid-19 deaths. contrast, excess mortality 21% publicly reported toll covid-19 Britain, 20% lower France. Places extremely mild pandemics, Australia, Norway, Taiwan, actually deficit rather excess deaths, meaning fewer people died overall average previous years.

In middle-income especially poor countries, conduct less testing covid-19 rich ones do, excess mortality almost always exceeds official death toll, often large margins. example, Romania, Iran, South Africa Mexico, excess deaths double officially attributed covid-19. Moreover, multipliers vary time. course pandemic, countries improved ability count deaths accurately. Others, particularly facing severe outbreaks, got worse.
Known unknowns

Data excess deaths available dozens countries, many places update frequently. mostly rich parts world, reliable measure pandemic’s true toll. However, countries report total death numbers long lags, surprisingly large number publish all. places also tend relatively little testing covid-19, meaning official death counts capture small share disease’s true impact. large majority world’s population lives regions, including India, China Africa, data excess deaths heavily delayed entirely unavailable.

The way fill continent-sized gaps data estimate them. Fortunately, lots statistics countries available, used make highly educated guesses. Virtually countries publish official counts covid-19 cases deaths, serve starting point. countries also report share covid-19 tests positive, used estimate magnitude under-counting cases. places, seroprevalence surveys offer estimates share population detectable antibodies SARS-CoV-2, virus causes disease, measure past infection. indicators may matter well, steps governments taken curb pandemic; extent people move around physically; systems government; media freedom; demography; geographic location. cases countries publish data, absence useful information itself.
Collect connect

To estimate excess deaths wherever whenever data unavailable—which places entirety pandemic, others particular time periods—The Economist gathered relevant information could find country (a full list sources categories provided below). total, used 121 different indicators, produced estimates 200 distinct countries territories. statistics, half constant time (an example demography, used population estimates 2019) half varied day (the number diagnosed covid-19 cases, extent people moved around according mobile phones). numbers unavailable many countries. improve predictions places, calculated weighted averages obtained neighbouring, nearby similar countries variable missing. avoid distortions caused specific day week data reported, aggregated daily numbers weekly averages.

After amassing predictors, lined data excess deaths, collecting year. tracker numbers 78 countries, drawing heavily Human Mortality Database World Mortality Dataset. addition, exercise, made extra effort obtain least partial data countries especially large populations, weigh heavily estimate global total. Using supplemental appendix article British Journal Medicine, able calculate 12 weeks data excess deaths China Chinese Centres Disease Control (which respond requests). India, could identify reliable data city Mumbai. Rather assuming one region representative India, models treat Mumbai separate country, could learn patterns apply elsewhere, India beyond. order strike balance information obtained big countries small ones, weighted data country logarithm population. meant eventual model would assign much importance Mexico Monaco, without ignoring latter entirely. Unfortunately, even high-vax areas well themselves, surges lower-vaxxed areas cause local hospitals export excess patients higher-vaxxed (and less stressed) areas. submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Having mood disorders, including depression, schizophrenia spectrum disorders make likely get severely ill  I'll never able forgive antivaxxers. many people killed lies dragging pandemic restrictions longer necessary. fair, don’t know *what* numbers really China, trying find numbers topic interest since beginning. current estimates total number cases range from, least, 170,000 to, most, potentially ten million. huge gap absolute upper lower limits, difficulty obtaining unofficial numbers, best say China likely accumulated least ten times many cases official count deliberately fudged numbers likely avoid causing panic among people rather achieve kind international deception. That, also fact Chinese cultural imperative self-sacrifice good greater community. basically vaccine solution? trying say? people lied said vaccines solution. Well, restrictions lockdowns clearly something wrong vaccine statement. yeah, I’m doublevaxxed btw.

Not now, vaccine reducing chances dying catch COVID, preventing illness. However, point future, maybe 12 24 months now, cases still pop deaths reduce thousands per day tenths even less ten, that's going require 90% world population either taken vaccine caught COVID. amount immunity. Pandemics eventually end.

Just hold measures bit longer friend. Trust me, even I'm sick weating mask I'm pro masking means lower cases, give pharmaceutical companies enough time develop successful treatment lower deaths/hospitalizations/or even chances getting long COVID.

Cases still rise lower, that's going happen coming years, forever, health authorities eventually look cases hospitalizations. two ways pandemic end:

* COVID keeps transmissible (or even rises transmisibility) becomes less deadly.
* COVID becomes much deadlier less transmissible.

Whatever one happens virus, us. Scientists stated virus likely stay forever, means us, governments, health authorities make manageable. normal life return. still tracking 5 vaccine approval month this? OK island really far away islands helps even cancel last year new variant totally control nobody vaccines, doubt they'll cancelling anything year.  got it, assuming 67% applies recovered cases, multiply 37M .33 include unvaccinated recovered. also calculated first part wrong initially, updating everything 70.5% huge increase 67% weird anywhere free education facemasks arent given covid spreading.

This estimate : 2020 excess death estimated 3 million. economist tell everyone finding it’s INVISIBLE SHADOW MEN?!?? happy you. Glad. probably is? lot places isn’t really space old cemeteries. mean sources got speak much lower numbers. 17 millions much higher estimate people estimated well. 

For example estimate excess mortality 3 million people 2020, much similar fully true Spanish flu hit young barely touched russian flu (the cocoa pandemic) before. young died due immune system going haywire (cycotine storm) [2020 Fatality Data Show Increased Traffic Fatalities Americans drove less 2020 due pandemic, NHTSA’s early estimates show estimated 38,680 people died motor vehicle traffic crashes—the largest projected number fatalities since 2007.This represents increase 7.2 percent compared the36,096 fatalities reported 2019. Preliminary data Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) shows vehicle miles traveled (VMT) 2020 decreased 430.2 billion miles, 13.2-percent decrease. fatality rate 2020 1.37 fatalities per 100 million VMT, 1.11 fatalities per 100 million VMT 2019.

Weird I’ve seeing numbers methods years. I’m guessing enclosed media diet.  Totally fine - sore arms worse flu shot far. 8 hours now. Holy shit thought also cautious COVID less likely affect little kids, small risk side effects likely higher risk COVID complications? That's know strain Spanish Flu. scientist kept digging Alaska half century PCR modern methods made possible extract genetic data recreate virus. Spoiler: regular H1N1, far know.

Population density 10x US  article mentions damage COVID sustentacular cells, support process smelling tasting. They're part brain. (One earlier hypotheses anosmia -- loss smell and/or taste -- maybe olfactory neuron cells directly attacked disease. new study suggests earlier hypothesis might wrong.) Texas... one star effort  Nobody ever dies l HIV either logic. writer article going wrong again. Early pandemic, stories China net-negative deaths covid+shutdowns, largely reductions air pollution heavy-industry paused. sure well know Colorado low vaxed counties really low population. That’s kind bogus number quote. Certainly people could get vaccinated whole Colorado done well getting poked. sure it’s getting hit hard right wonder anything low numbers seen pandemic. Seems like states swells maybe happens time. know hospitals area (Northern Colorado) taking patients Surrounding states like Nebraska, Wyoming South Dakota. I’m sure that’s helping ICU numbers. Nah. say aware many scary viruses pathogens evolve mutate sort shit epidemiologists track. natural cover gets chopped around world climate change gets worse, expect new pathogens show up. there's melting permafrost worry ancient scourge ready face warmer world. actually bad I've expecting past 20 years. People understand important human contact humans, especially young old. Would leave baby alone day except 5 minutes? elders self-sufficient, lose need human interaction.

What happened name protecting people covid recognized abuse. 70% vaccination although higher places still surges. Delta infectious would much worse vaccines. Imagine Delta hit last year attitudes people had. *cough* FLU!!! places like Denmark Gibraltar? restrictions never going away entirely. Bureaucrats like give power. Cool. showed bunch data sets showing relative risk. show published papers. 

It’s solvable problem likely means need make multi-shot series like hepatitis DTap. Doesn’t mean vaccines don’t work, clearly do.

No amount geography going help incompetent governments   keep trying tell anti vaxers: got death wish, maybe hold something quick painless. covid not. you’re Australia they’re right. One countries life expectancy went year expected deaths went negative. son’s pediatricians office went “we’re sure we’re getting it” 8am “actually got shipment today, want appointment tomorrow?” 2pm. would keep following up, maybe they’ll get shipment soon. So, worried? Lol Source?

You see SEVERAL countries risks unvaccinated far higher regardless time vaccination. 

I’m gullible. read many data sets globally. comes individual too. cases kept 'hush hush' area people someone ended ICU point spread sheer denial.

People problem, right top government dominant corporation, straight lowest lurker. fucking suck.  india 70% deaths typically get certificate. normal times peak delta April - may number likely less.  'yesterday today' different 'permanent' ... expect restrictions 2025? 2030? people upvoted comment downvoted yours? I'm parent. kids vaccinated, ....  ten different origin stories Spanish Flu. China latest greatest origin story.
“China one regions world seemingly less affected Spanish flu pandemic, several studies documented comparatively mild flu season 1918.[137][138][139] (Although disputed due lack data Warlord Period, see Around globe.) led speculation Spanish flu pandemic originated China,[139][140] lower rates flu mortality may explained Chinese population's previously acquired immunity flu virus.[141][139]” Uncertainty today pretty much every government blatantly lying save face excuses

Not necessarily. way certain death count would test every single person died since Jan 2020 COVID. beginning even good test COVID, even tests available enough lab capacity test every single sick person made best guesses based symptoms timing.

Sure, governments (Russia, China, India) purposely covered data unknown degree, even wanted completely honest simply test capacity so. 72% deaths Singapore last six months weren’t fully-vaccinated. 

The vaccines work far momentarily better work booster/update schedules time. first gen vaccines they’ve brought risk considerably. It’ll get better. 

Enough whiny doomsday.   What?? *Another* study showing ivermectin useless? I'm shocked! Well, shocked. Students also wear masks moving classes

That actually sounds like reasonable compromise.   that's lost job morgue. People dieing get there. remotely equivalent. question boosters policy value preventing mild moderate infections. ignoring scientific evidence consensus, disagreeing policy decision message sent antivaxxers allowed people use boosters preventing mild moderate infections. distinction pretty damn arbitrary far broader media suggests, people lied probably thought lying.

Portraying way equivalent antivaxxers shit take.   Russia going next huge uncontained delta outbreak? Like original outbreak India? Even earliest work also suggested that, express ACE-2 receptors, support cells do. study would seem confirm hypothesis.

See e.g. (which cited paper).  link good read.     
I happened upon it.   
r/askhistorians pretty interesting.   Gotta say I'm looking forward next flu epidemic.

Good news, seems corona precautions seemed work well flu-like Except past year, things different: 2020–21 flu season, United States recorded 2,000 cases, 17,000 times fewer 35 million recorded season before. season, flu killed 199 children; past season, far know, killed “We’ve looked flu communities doctors’ offices hospitals, we’ve gotten almost zero,” says Emily Martin, University Michigan epidemiologist who’s part CDC’s flu-monitoring network. true seasonal respiratory viruses last winter, says Saskia Popescu, epidemiologist George Mason University Virginia, though since rebounded. RSV, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus—for while, vanished.

If normalise (staying clean, distance possible, masks sick, people getting vaccinated) could reduce overall number infection type viruses (to degree) even without lockdowns. news garbage. Pharma stay away children Yea end. nearly typing angry comment saw /s  India, live close area talking about. India vast country many different customs practices followed different people. majority burn dead, vast chunk bury (Christians Muslims), feed carnivores (Parsis), saw burying dead banks river. happened also rained like never soil shifted.

The burning grounds hotspots overflowing. like saw NYC, LA cities Texas, trucks piling bodies lined hallways hospitals buildings. Things different India compared anywhere else. confident data US.

This true even vaccinations. certificates US, UK Canada hand written (making easy duplicate), done India digitally. Every vaccine shot linked unique ID receiver. robust system also seem flaws changes made. literally one comes challenge data US, UK Canada. family like that. impossible talk them. escaped reality. mainstream news sources (even Fox) giant conspiracy. estimate lower bound. read TF article lower bound Economist 10.5m fairly consistent look ratio official deaths vs estimated lower bound. ""vaccine **NO** - burn schools **YES** huraaaaa""

Wtf wrong people? Interesting. source? Pfizer saying month 5-11 recent announcement seems indicate there's unexpected significant delay expected early 2022 now.  😂 think ends… yep massive undercounts everywhere..... folk go average deaths per year 5-10 years shocking high....  


this isnt .. oh... hey ... im right ..you wrong...  


its fucking sad, itss many families affected 6mo-4y cohort greater risk 5-11 cohort. covid poses far greater risk.

You'd know things spend time drunk misinformation ""free thinkers"" repeat whatever antivax group says. Oh wow know. long time changed decision guess. Thank informing us! Thats interesting, would mind sharing source?   big surprise. That's announcing major unexpected delay statements month ago. think want everyone get vaccinated asap higher benefit… previous infected people don’t matter they’re small %. avoid talk push everyone matter case get vaccinated. sure governments across globe fudging numbers accurate tally. They'll sweep ""little black death"" carpet optics. they're cremating corpses tested. sure number even greater 20 mil. Italy give ONE year get one single dose infection. sure got number yeah, recommend 6m-1y get one shot only. Quarantine work well Delta shorter incubation time. People become infectious 2 days exposure (and 2 days exhibit symptoms). time case zero gets PCR test result back contacts traced, contacts already passed on. They're probably expanding available times accommodate surge.

When made flu shot appointment days ago booster appointment couple months ago latest could get 5pm slots, even CVS 24 hour pharmacy. last decade, research shown spanish flu genetically similar western hemisphere variants going around animals, unambiguously points origin American content. fumbled boosters? kids, possibly 12s, approved month 2 sooner. younger kids, see. children 5 - 12 age range concerned vaccine approved time soon.

However still clue covid got first place.  feel bad gonna get first shot Nov 11th, health insurance since May, since college student age 24, insured via parents anymore money insurance, since broke student job (which would've required health insurance anyway).

When finally insurance (thanks grandparents lending ton money) October wanted get vaccinated one mobile vax teams, require ID, mine, course, lost validity Sep 1st doctor go yet, since moved job. Getting new ID also hard, obviously working barely time go registration office would take weeks receive new ID well.

It really want get vaccinated, could, still insured still doctor, vaccines still restricted risk groups elderly, part of. scared hell covid, especially long covid, young age already 1 crippling chronic condition day die, definitely want long covid.

My whole story probably sounds like load bullshit excuses, really happen (simplified), obviously circumstances unique, trying best get vaxxed asap. next troublesome part gonna figuring get second shot, since longer duration (up point ofc) increases effectiveness long run, want, since god knows age group eligible booster shot, also wanna get full protection asap. Fuck me. Since deaths co-morbidities age 60 included covid 19 death count, suppose deaths purely covid-19 must less 1m . Aren’t people earlier cases getting reinfected bad cases delta variant? understand lack excitement. Hopefully opens door crazy ""mRNA alters DNA"" get vaccinated. Like decrease car accidents (which actually even happen, somehow, according studies, though logically I'd thought they'd fallen significantly)? No. lockdowns covid deaths would so, much higher.  odds dying something else 2 week span Covid infection pretty freaking low. Especially lockdowns significantly reducing deaths car accidents accidents working. Though increased deaths addiction, so.. knows. I'd wager well 90% people died month covid died result Covid.

My dad died Covid. ventilator days *massive* stroke, blood doctor said he'd literally ever seen covered brain. stroke almost certainly result Covid's effects vascular systems circulation blood. maybe already blood clot covid? Totally possible. Would eventually killed him? Totally possible. would killed two weeks? highly doubt it. months leading infection saying frequently he'd never felt better / healthier life looking forward playing another summer softball together. Economist superb: routinely used competitive debating, reading weekly good grounding solid argument make well-informed pretty much every serious news story makes international news (and quite don't.) know masks really effective getting vaxxed ive done really tiring wearing mask hard live normally wearing it. really wont consider normal living still masks matter? died, would died whatever else, also infected covid, Covid still reason died. died get hospital, hospital full Covid patients, covid STILL reason died, even even covid. 

Excess mortality tells many people died year ""should have"" based many people died every year this. Death rates remarkably stable. Serious natural disasters, regional warfare, bad flu seasons shift numbers some, there's predictable range. suddenly get year like 2020, deaths spike way predictable range, ""new thing"" happened new disease, take much processing power understand new disease responsible excess deaths.   Accountability government dictatorship… that’s new concept right there. It’s china, it’s propaganda, cases make look bad that’s line top. It’s accountability. accountability would access wuhan tracing origins. 
Don’t naive.  perfectly valid reasons happening, mean anyone bad job developing vaccines, vaccines ""failing"".

I say vaccines work. gotten shots booster would get another when/if approved. 

But limit vaccine shot protect someone respiratory infection vs. intranasal vaccine. 

I idea post downvoted. anti-vax post saying mRNA work. mRNA shots prevent COVID spreading upper respiratory tract major organs, prevents severe COVID. mRNA shot provide enough nAbs nose throat stop infection, especially months. intranasal vaccine might fix that. call 4 10 kids Covid-19 ( Europe) small %?

Cause death sometimes/often reported Covid, Covid smoking gun changed 2020. proper sanitation field hospitals, ZERO VENTILATORS (literally probably 98% folks survived Covid intubation would died Covid 1918, that's shitload people), rudimentary surgical techniques. 

We use antibiotics viruses. Maybe get associated pneumonia though? I'm sure, pneumonia caused bacterially, literally caused covid exploding alveoli, however, build fluid lungs prime real estate secondary bacterial infection sure. mean. scientific article really important specific methodology use many scientists go tweak around see get better results using methods.  too, often deliberate undercount going make impossible ever accuracy. don’t expect much thing, know? correct answer.

It’s hard describe fear relief. son also rare life threatening disorder, (1:300,000) 16 became eligible March immediately got it. wait long line children’s hospital. relief sublime indelible moment. Add least two zeros China's official numbers, maybe three.  Sounds right. 1/3rd people get it, 0.6% die. numbers sound fairly par data even last year.  According idiots flu. keep coming back re-reading it’s weirdly given lot comfort made think perspective well, instead own. Thank 💜 study also 2020 Economist numbers include 2021 deaths. estimate 2020 deaths 5.8 million. Facts care feelings, mydude obvious understand matter what, endgame involves tax money. assuming care happens people share society with.  live somewhere seeing maybe 1 2 cases week statewide mandatory quarantine.   
We close zero COVID possible world.  
Yet, rushed get vaccines, wear mask everywhere people public wearing masks, majority people still basic social distancing avoid crowded indoor environments.    
None see extendingly paranoid honestly barely think much more.   
We covid, outbreak, usually week spread know it, basic simple precautions makes sense.   
Each precaution adds percent protection, swap one protection another getting additional benefits.

Right, federal states immediately said: No, want that.  10% people living US Covid. small number worth talking about?  believe got booster (half) dose. went Moderna booster (a) maybe different antibodies (b) bc think studies shown protection fades little slower Pfizer. really surprise anyone.

Even though read every week...  got 2 doses moderna second one quite ""strong"". felt cold, hot, fever 38.5-39. terrible night... lasted one day, although evening day 37.5 went friends... exactly tell anti-maskers. 

Them: ""Those things useless"".

Me: ""Do know *anybody* flu last year?"" indeed... Lol.  Community transmission still rampart many parts world years/decades come. Reducing community transmission Denmark, country &lt;6 million affect that. there's also talk animal reservoirs deer game animals.

Most experts saying Covid become endemic, eradicated.  much better medicines now.  
This pandemic also closely related war times, lot peoples moving around big groups (troops), without proper diet, care even warm place sleep. fucking masons, man. Ever since George Washington Benjamin Franklin Gates they've fucking us.   good hear! Hope continue well side effects may second dose smooth! We're Illinois drive vaccine clinic pediatrician (it's 30-40 degree highs rn want long outdoor lines).


Glad hear little biddy side effects!  know people felt sick day two getting Moderna shot (fever/flu-like symptoms), know anyone felt sick Pfizer that's anecdotal course.

Did get full dose booster dose? Also, choose Moderna booster? Unsure get third Pfizer Moderna... chest pain Pfizer shots. better worse [Quality adjusted life lost somewhat well known metric. anyone know anyone got slammed Moderna booster? Pfizer - Pfizer - Moderna. Got shot Tuesday evening. Wednesday felt worst ever remember feeling. two different thermometers measured temperatures around 104.6 right next ibuprofen dose. Ibuprofen brought 102ish. Woke morning, Thursday, still fever 101. Definitely improvement taken ibuprofen 8 hours, still sick.

Edit: felt fine first shot, somewhat sick second - took sick day day 2 still able putz around house. woke day 3 feeling perfectly fine.   It’s random depending are. Currently area mandates, majority people still wear stores, workplaces schools. Rarely people wear restaurants bars though you’re eating/drinking. feel like we’re sort point one cares whether you’re wearing one out. like wearing mine, don’t judge aren’t 🤷‍♀️. could get really ugly. Oof  seem grasp ARTICLE SAYS NOTHING PEOPLE QUIT. know hammer home better putting caps. lose 10% workforce remaining, 95% vaccinated saying workforce 95% vaccinated accurate little misleading think? That's seem get. number need even article. Reddit believes healthcare workers representative general working population kind ridiculous whatever. numbers used make sad, make angry. Fauci right - there’s going lot death with. OSHA idea enforce this, says rely people report violations.

That sounds horrible. bit history similar self-reporting systems getting flooded false information.  think consider Covid around anyone started officially keeping track argue counts would inaccurate. article say something it.

You're pleased answer.

20 120 ""very limited number.""

You're thus thread without single number approaching 15%. Even 5% upper bound anything linked here.

You're grasping straws know it.  Also Fauci disclosed Live TV Vaccines dont stop transmission,

Who fuck said stops transmission? Covid 19s recovery rate 95%

Long haulers survival rate ~99%. 99% US population. 800,000 people far died Covid, that's size San Francisco. Imagine entire city wiped say vaccines 100% work, there's use vaccine, conclude.

And bad. work, NOTHING 100%. think that, leave. always risk. good job preventing death handful vaccinated died Covid. IIRC think they’ve found genes parts West Africa reduce Covid risk well. much needed voice optimism! thank this.

I live rural area largest companies around school districts, right. bigger picture make difference. Agreed. anticipation waiting hear test would unnecessarily anxiety-producing considering control. wait answer. question probably variable based ventilation system, size rooms, etc. However, according Aerosolized coronavirus remain air three hours. like imagine world whole thing began literally anyone else office. never become political. sad. answering question honestly, wearing seatbelt, wearing hardhat, electrical wiring codes don’t come small risk myocarditis Employers don’t testing don’t give time testing  Uh what? 100% stricter States. basically US too.   think ton companies 100-500 employee range ignore this. Fortune 500 companies alone account 17% US workforce. expand biggest 2500 companies, there’s lot people going show proof vaccination. 

It’s going solve virus own, combined boosters shots kids, think go long way toward keeping things control.  prior studies showing anxiety depression negative effects immune system. Seems possibly related? know that's true. think plenty employers enforce mandate people complain OSHA they're forced so.  find hard OSHA enforce ultimately leave honor system. 

With vaccine mandates restaurants stores, still guidelines system verify customer's vaccine status present fake vaccine card test. safety employees, hard believe that, businesses might check vaccine status. That’s wild. Work generation side 80% employees transmission end company vaccinated. I’ve heard months ago. call bullshit Honestly, concern mandates… HR department going hard time… Going employment opportunities opening rest us. government handled terrible   Yes. Also booster vaccination campaign atrocious, around 90% people vaxxed remains uninterested vaccine see, hope fully recovered!  municipalities similar data presentations. 80-90% deaths unvaccinated seems typical currently, despite majority high-risk people (i.e. old) vaccinated.

I don’t know anti-vax people look data conclude vaccines “don’t work”. Tying victory dances cases recipe really bad time.  like voting, sadly.  requirements apply people work home outdoors.

So doesn’t apply fuck ton people. Example article granted religious exemption refuses weekly testing. sure say that. new level me.  100 workers must implement mandatory vaccination program and/or mandate weekly testing masks refuse vaccine.

Around 20 million would technically exempt they're employed businesses one hundred employees.

I can't imagine public start questioning small businesses street vendors they're vaccinated.  People use online time cards. work app use clock on. don’t think going inside bathroom significant enough since employee technically working outside.

Lots jobs exclusively outside. Park rangers, lawn care/outdoor care, mail carriers, outdoor workers places like amusement parks zoos petting zoos, outdoor venue workers (like amphitheater), outdoor party workers (like people taking ticket entering place staffing blow bouncy house), sports workers (I used work exclusively outdoor soccer day program example), lifeguards outdoor pool/aquatics center…

Sure, people may take breaks inside. they’re technically working inside. Point is- think plenty jobs solely outdoors. don’t think indoor bathroom breaks enough purpose considered working indoors/needing vaccine.

But clarify… I’m disappointed personally outdoor workers aren’t included requirement around tons people still technically outdoors! think one reasons young people afraid getting vaccines fear rushed even though research shows it’s efficient virus. seemed think 100% effective considered safe even though doesn’t vaccine diseases history 100% efficient. time holidays. They'll pay fine. way cheaper. government fines usually end jokes anyway.  immune systems need trained/exposure (and better getting sick cases young old.) course would ideal could vaccinate 100 cold-causing viruses, that's impractical.

I'm saying ""live-and-let-die."" I'm saying ""live-and-let-get-midly-ill-on-occasion."" vaccinate widely dangerous illnesses minimize risk practical. I'm vaccinated things you, assure you. structure society around everyone who's post-leukemia? really realistic. Parents still get sick kids (trust me, two 'em) doctors still get sick patients (I'm married physician.) can't min-max away illnesses. you.

I think perhaps different perspective I'm likely older lived worse illnesses (and surgeries.) Life goes on. recognize anxiety believe that's legitimate concern, I've lived many awful health issues world goes on. march toward death eventually, may well go grace constant concern occasional bad thing.

If never heavy foods maybe gallbladder attack. then... would've missed delicious food. never played sports/did outdoorsy stuff I'd probably fewer scars. then... would've missed adventures. gotta accept bad good. morning went talk manager, reading article computer ""How right back mandates"".

Wonder going new manager soon? hope not, whole vaccine mask issue great dude. Honestly surprised took path this. knew before, character. Better late never  data currently tracked CDC? Asking I'm genuinely curious ratio's are. admire confidence ;) Delta offspring confirmed infectious? Guaranteed point become dominant? Many/most double vaccinated people likely get boosted, taking equation. 30-50% kids 5-11 getting doubly vaccinated next months. added immunity greatly counter presumed surge?

As example, Israel dropped 6-7% positivity boosting 0.7% yesterday.

I personally know, saying goes Scott G said yesterday example. always find interesting laymen speak authority :) feel same. WA state masks required basically everywhere hate it. Fully vaxxed understand importance still want wear them. local area still 40% vaccinated. going verrrry interesting watch play work. authoritarian government fining businesses inspecting equipment construction site providing protective eyewear factory? Federal government, OSHA, long charged ensuring workplaces safe. vaccine/test mandate different. employer actively checking, we're federal contractor. Show even one case spontaneous death attributed vaccine. sorry also dealing this. hard. know else say except wanted know alone feel you. I’m struggling think job that’s solely outdoors. Don’t people go inside punch time clock too? I’m sure instances applies, none coming mind.  Wow - they're good time. I'm sure exceptions big reality check coming lot folks soon. Wow, none said true. like applied everything country extrapolated China. search ""walking china"" videos Youtube. Everyone there, everyone wearing mask, everything 100% opened. lockdowns even close happens Chinese New Year, example, kill small restaurant due loss expected profit, even government provides support pay wages rent.

China like light-years ahead consumer technology. Restaurants operate lockdown issues everyone already used ordering online stuff delivered.

The ability population confident going what's important. entire country fully opened year half interrupted short local lockdowns. Contrast countries places perpetually operating reduced capacity.

It's MUCH better zero-covid policy country fully opened 95% time, hard localized lockdown, fully reopen again, perpetually 60% open ""living COVID"".

Every country abandoned zero-covid policy governments lost control gave up. Yeah that’s game plan. nervous since lot wives pregnant I’d never wanna potentially put risk. 

Someone deleted comment saying text ask friend, I’d rather put unnecessary stress heading wedding. big day already postponed due Covid. get positive test start showing symptoms I’ll make call. Pretty easy bin deaths vaccination status. None reasons justify requiring permit, IMO.   someone legitimate medical condition, no. insurance/medicaid etc would cover that.

This incredibly good comparison, fairly recent thing prior government getting involved, companies poor cybersecurity practices way hold accountable. choices. could mandate let people live lives. 40k mine nationwide maybe 200 location? idea companywide numbers would that’s decent sample size feel like mirror nationwide vaccination rate would fair estimate. 

There short stint summer allowed fully vaccinated employees go without face masks voluntarily showed card HR time would say maybe half?

Some employers choose make vaccine mandatory instead allow testing option, result OSHA order. imagine big company deal people sending like 1,000 test results week? employers mandate vaccine less work themselves. meant comparing equivalent.

It's lighthearted observation also people end spectrum go way get vaccines.

More ""I know people desperate protect themselves, fuckers refusing get vaccinated..."" They've come along way taking bets many employees would catch disease. pneumonia caused bacterially

Actually [in ""Up 75% infected influenza go acquire pneumonia, confirmed bacterial co-infection."" thus would better chance survival ""Data show hospitalized patients COVID-19 likely get secondary bacterial fungal infections hospital (called hospital-onset infections). contrast, hospitalized patients influenza-like illness often got secondary bacterial fungal infections community (called community-onset infections) hospitalization."" Disagree. people aren’t wearing mask it’s necessary weren’t going wear one anyway. Covid never going “over” live forever like viruses. say it’s “far over” reporting news like fear mongering. people vaccinated fear living Covid definitely time. 5-11 vaccinated it’s matter time indoor masking longer necessary unless you’re risk factors. places prevalence low and/or vaccination rates high, indoor masking isn’t really even necessary now. IMO lets say record 10 data sets, one really low number one really high number give range rather avg, cost true avg hard estimate. Spanish flew went young… Wow. I'm amazed see people already got kids first dose. pediatrician started taking appointments yesterday 1pm fully booked time checked 3pm.

It made 10 year happy see many kids getting vaccinated. trustworthy this? Apparently people using proof vaccines  feel weird this, honestly.   controversial  half dose.

An additional full dose available people received Moderna first two shots immunocompromised. sure. think people guilty growing complacent, especially vaccination. pub went really good ventilation restricting numbers (its bowling club bar inside, frequented mostly older folk) goes show easily picked up. much socialising groups friends since one gone cancer treatment last year. wild ride, cherry cake alas, life life.  nothing causes anything then?

But know, endemic, way higher risk get shot anyway.

If something *going* happen, want terms, less consequences, natures terms consequences? Winter comes Colorado first lower 48, everybody living like covid doesn’t exist even though 61% vaccinated. Yes, know, keep shit yourself.  Government numbers. 40217 new infections. national coronavirus task force Thursday said 1,195 people died COVID-19 past day, exceeding 1,189 recorded previous day. Since late September, Russia tallied new highs infections deaths almost daily.

3rd wave really never ended. 35% Russia’s nearly 146 million people fully vaccinated coronavirus, even though Russia approved domestically developed vaccine coronavirus months countries.

Still lagging fully vaccinated. Moscow surrounding region, together account nearly 25% new daily infections, nonworking period won’t extended beyond Nov. 7, officials said. 
  restrictions remain place Russian capital, stay-at-home order older adults mandate businesses 30% staff work home. Access theaters museums limited either fully vaccinated, recovered COVID-19 within last six months present negative coronavirus test. 


But 15% population. Hope one week semi-lockdown helped. reports Russia’s state statistical service Rosstat tally coronavirus-linked deaths retroactively reveal much higher mortality numbers task force’s. report released last week indicated 462,000 people COVID-19 died April 2020 last September. 
Russian officials said task force includes deaths COVID-19 main cause uses data collected medical facilities. Rosstat uses wider criteria counting virus-related deaths takes numbers civil registry offices process registering death finalized. 


Even months Rosstat corrects number Covid deaths, still excess deaths Covid deaths. Community spread pneumonia old age cause deaths spiked last year. 


Excess deaths 800k now. Yeah know. I'm worried since prehypertension know could worsen get mycarditis opposite. Im also young would fall Scandinavias suspension group, got moderna twice. germany gave moderna vaccination centres, get booster likely biontech dose, probably would prefer anyways, studies suggest higher antibody response (but antibodies small part protection). Anyways, id take moderna aswell offered, offered, STIKO evidence yet suggest young people need atm.   Well yeah, want risk someone getting sick hospital weeks missing work, endangering workers miss work isolate got sick, want pay medical treatment either. got word yesterday kids get jab ❤️

I’m gonna refreshing web page every hour get 8 year-old signed 🤞🏻  March me, still here, least one ear really them. vast majority used mRNA first place. risk far LOWER happen getting covid-19 itself. high risk area, indoors, many people different households, alcohol, tabacco, probably bad ventilation, check-ins vaccination., masks. never really know got from. Everyone consider activities resonable take go colder/indoor months shouldnt practise victim blaiming. illnesses also dont differentiate someone smoker etc. 2cents it.  good news. never eliminate COVID vaccines antiviral meds target COVID hopefully eliminate COVID related fatalities. Mandates completely dependent particular state municipality. nationwide mandate public transportation air travel. it’s state level, many states delegated city county level governments. That's pretty late UK regulators already enough data conclude.   They're 7, they're babies. Guess another lockdown Europe inevitable else world bear brunt  Yes, wondering vaccines. kind worried since Moderna suspended age group Scandinavia planning mix-and-match Pfizer Moderna No, people deciding *NOT* risk *others* health....quite different protecting yourself. mindset west lost on. due culture. general, Coloradans live active social lifestyle, difficult get people stop long. also schools, especially think Denver Public Mesa. Maybe Douglas County, too. Schools big hotspot. read article yet, annual mortality data give us strong estimate. records data like Spanish flu. Unless you’re someone actually studies public health, it’s like, main metric use… authorities diagnosed 6,268 people COVID-19, highest daily figure since 10 April, 107 people died coronavirus-related diseases past 24 hours. Daily fatalities high since early May. number new cases jumped 55% week-on-week, currently 77% people SARS-CoV-2 hospital week ago. 3,366 people coronavirus infection hospital, 349 ventilator, compares 4,871 people hospital 355 ventilator year ago. Damn it, I’m either going spend whole day compiling research, could tell floor-and-ceiling estimates acquired demographics, transmissibility known variants, family lives there, news various different countries. don’t consider numbers accurate Fermi estimate; it’s number guess general state things might use establishing baseline. Probably mentioned first, pridurok. Everyone bit immune system lag I'd assume. Cause reading, every article would generalize mRNA vaccines, super rare side effect (mycarditis), wondering two doses altogether. way limit transmission welcome pandemic, even that's door seat back. definitely makes sense, adds up. wont EVER make sense selfish and/or think grand scale things. feel relief news. I'm sad daughter wait list pediatrician. Number 15 line. thought wear masks indoors US? Ive seeing lots videos online go clubs parties dancing crowded bar masks on. mean im mad im really jealous guys now. Yeah, like many return work good friend work died covid realized worth risk.  Keep mind mycarditis pericarditis happens people catch covid aswell cases severe infected people. Additionally mycarditis isnt problem severily ill people face. unlikely individual, adds substantial numbers entire population. every person US caught covid exactly once, expect around 100,000 coincidental deaths within 2 weeks catching it. enough complicating factor.  hope family gets well soon. Yes, inevitable covid stay generations. everything right reduce risk infection still catch it. Obviously vaccinated people lot better protected vaccinated. Take care. supply issue. decision made gov. even child wants get 2 nd shot, vaccine center would give him, gov decide go ahead. think 16- 17 approved second shots recently. 

It's weird reasoning second dose may cause myocarditis young people. really frustrating, chances adverse effects way lower vaccine actual covid. even choice even wanted take risk vaccinating kids. Vaccines measured doses therefore predictable. wild infections, varying factors give varying outcomes. quarter don’t develop antibodies example. Vaccine induced immunity don’t last forever even predictable. are, like cases vaccinated people getting bad breakthrough cases, studies matter important ""no shit shirlock"" issue That's considered new normal. might seeing/having wear masks future flu seasons, local outbreaks, etc.

We get much better wearing needed though, that's sure. hope lost. Plus pay rate “essential” jobs shit. see chains advertising increased minimum wages 15-23 dollars. least area, places haven’t able staff properly (restaurants mainly). Waitresses waiters sick terrible pay. work tips one comes eat? like caught then. guess surprised someone would lie internet.

Your profile free read elaborate doxxing. post regularly /r/NorthernIreland /r/Belfast. best way reduce hospitalizations reducing transmission. done vaccinating many people possible, including children proven safe. Viruses vaccines general cause inflammatory response....that's partly feel like shit vaccine. Unfortunately way much wrong spots much way predict it. mRNA general. cases mixed doses etc., data still collected. wait till ski season full swing! :( county? big claims zero data back up.  Currently enduring second round covid much unpleasant first, even vaccination earlier year. Caught one parents, hospital it. They'd done well avoiding now, guess inevitable.  punishment. form triage. Yup! based data time though.

Looks possible. 

Problem is, kids vaxxed, show less experience less symptoms least outwardly, mingle school, bring home, unknown, parent gets it, spreads workplace, fellow employee spreads community, circle continues. Yes, innate immune systems response, severity absence implication protection get vaccine.  I've read moderna booster half dose original shot. got J&amp;J shot originally, ask ""moderna booster"" giving half dose, full thing? hope 6 year old go Eric Cartman cvs fight it. three would take two shots arm notice, war. can’t get extra shot 12-15? would thought UK would similar supply IS. asked pediatrician said get shot now. kids 8 days school year late August.. something need fact check?? Like, people would believe probably give shit fact checking. $136,000 per violation max employer ""totally disregards mandate""

So $1,360,000 minimum (100 employees minimum) want gamble fines. current ones effective. couple comments mentioned it, added main one since seems top

Remote employees exempt long they're truly fully remote. UK passes (increasingly) masks. Watch us - see whether drop masks not. we? Probably - anyone feels ill wear one limit spread illness, whatever might be, east Asia. understand, people legitimate medical reasons get vaccinated few. small number people allergic components mRNA vaccines, J&amp;J ingredients. vice-versa allergens J&amp;J. already rare allergies need allergic both. Mine  big corporations lobbied push mandate back till holidays they'd lose much workforce. guess I’m trying parse mean “messed up”. forcing people participate study they’d probably harmed, would indeed messed up, hope government would pay serious price that. don’t think needs political price this, since doesn’t harm anyone (it gives people opportunities harm want to, most). understand is, Stiko need longer everyone else analyze data? instance, first recommend vaccines 12+, data already suggests benefits outweigh risks, let's rather say risks infection vaccination low. Later, new data far know, recommend it.
They also could recommended boosters soon Israel showed make huge difference transmission still done so.
Mertens, head Stiko, initially thought 100,000 people vaccinated day vaccination entire population would take 2022.
I'm sure they're good scientists, put double triple checking pragmatism, costing lives. much likely post-pandemic (at least next decade so) a) would pick ongoing testing SARS-CoV-2 b) countries would take seriously nip bud NPIs tracing became established. spread globally, existing vaccines treatments might well help, would matter months create new vaccine. read mandate don’t give time pay test. someone got side effects (fever headache) second pfizer dose, get moderna booster? UAW going exempt end, hoops jump get there. Sounds like Ford getting head start non-union portion workforce.  could still lose them... others covid.

This like stacking trash top falls that's take out. Completely avoidable situation, thay passing buck. fines profit OSHA. idea companywide numbers would be

According mandate ask! You, employee, ask many Total Employees are, plus breakdown vaccinated unvaccinated employees are.  end next business day provide you. employers \_do\_ testing themselves, accept 3rd party test results, order avoid deal forged results.

This fine. fully support right wear mask protect yourself.

Looking broader dataset seen hospitalisations denmark increasing: people fearful catching COVID still wear regardless requirement not.

I said thread social media got absolutely slammed it. Even got blocked people. People EXTREMELY touchy subject.

I firmly believe point afraid covid, wear mask. mandate others wear them.

Mandating masks makes sense health system overburdened. damn mandates need stop. Fair enough realise liberal interpretation Europe. Yes! 🎉 website work. basically stopped testing

It's like eased everyone lockdowns. damn well knew airborne spreading air like wildfire, knew already months before. knew masks needed. bought masks months prior recommending mandating them. said wash hands (literally never spreads like know fact).

They slowly reported it, picked pace, downplayed increased seriousness time, still, people panic bought got unruly. Pretty lame lie whole time, see logic, know humans especially Americans irrational panicky, fully honest start, tell stay home wear mask shut everything immediately.

Of course, excess deaths alone might full death toll, too, considering lockdowns reduced causes death. able explain 87% excess deaths seems pretty good contrasted countries unexplained 10x gap. crack open couple cold ones. There's also ""covid"" deaths people losing care result pandemic. Captured excess deaths attributed since Covid direct cause.

some what? factory workers? cooks? non-medical professionals?

I say pretty rigid cause/effect reporting system deaths--covid not. medical community likely nearly agreement deaths types. virtue signalling knobs really realize losers  didn’t also get sick stuff COVID?

Kid covid early October. She’s fine feel like I’m rush get vaccinated infection. dad way, pisses end No. says chickenpox risk significant, primarily adults also zero children.

Adults typically get chickenpox immunity childhood. Either children get natural immunity suffering chickenpox, children get immunity vaccine. That's says 20-80% childhood vaccination rate happen: beneficial lucky subset vaccinated children, remaining children would become likely get neither due partial herd immunity... becomes much bigger problem adults.

COVID obviously facing ""20-80% childhood adulthood"" problem anytime soon. Perhaps importantly, idea chickenpox strategy would *ever* work COVID; notably durability natural immunity COVID seems significantly worse already... Thankfully, proven alternative strategy: vaccinate adults!

Regardless, giving vaccine individual child beneficial particular child. Read whole paper… know unfortunate part think would great punishment, state constitutionally could order that, would easily fall cruel unusual punishment. degree would sentence death outdoor conditions reduced service potentially result fatality. state could authorize though eliminate liability though...

Unfortunately would useless deterrent. unvaccinated nutjobs a) dont think COVID real b) dont believe theyll get c) dont believe possible end hospital it. news littler kids eligible?  yo sorry buddy, without internet past month.

That's gonna problem. Serious question someone three doses two kids. know totally worth it? data supports it? 2500 cases Europe? What’s scarier also don’t take account many homeless people died Covid either, statistics based primarily hospital cases. Sure agree also wonder issue also contributing well least minor way. That's still accurate.

What there's increase deaths new deregulations happened year companies could pollute water. deaths thanks polluted water? way around? less deaths year final year stricter regulations put place make buildings safer cases fire something huge uptick businesses complying measure?

Covid-19 thing happening. world complex things effect death toll.

Do account less traffic accidents since less driving 2020, example? There's easy way measure death certificates tell whole story can't even filter stuff car accidents whatnot.

Death certificate says someone liver failure. get hospital? rejected hospital due full? lose insurance? find late? depends covid effect not. problem accurate tracking is, covid causes damaging inflammation organs, blood vessels, nerves, etc. organs already damaged over-stressed go severe stress damaging inflammation (using dam example; turns hairline cracks dam structural damage throughout entire dam, difficult predict failure occur difficult figure fact).

Feeling relieved. take 5 common variants US, none originated US. global pandemic, variants created globally. statement true article even back statement. Even though vaccinated people contagious, they're significantly less likely get first place equally likely spread it.... heard plenty people say hospitals got payments every Covid death coding everything Covid-caused. Basically everyone dying, lot usual. idk firefighters…but it’s likely you’ll shot pizza deliveryman cop.

Yes vaccine really prevent getting it, though decent job it, main objective prevent dying, great job it. idea get vaccinated likely get it, die.

There’s Del Taco around corner that’s offering starting pay like $18/hr (not advise that) seeing originated china it’s stretch say nobody it. looks like used macro-level data, macro-level poverty levels extremely easy control yes would bet controlled poverty. can’t guarantee don’t see article itself, doubt would get peer reviewed without income, poverty, cumulative disadvantage measure sort.

And say macro-level it’s clear looked county state level. mention data county-level may aggregated state (they discuss states implications) I’m unsure. Either way, country-level poverty-related measures super easy get could aggregated state wanted, could get state-level measures.

My thought mental health may cause lower overall health, know lower overall health makes susceptible covid.

Vaccine mandates same. protect you, mostly intended protect people around making bad decision stay unvaccinated spreading others. 

Your rights end mine begin. That's mandates regulations. plenty carrots around entice make good choices. mandates stick. Look Tyson private company wants enforce vaccine mandate that’s fine. It’s bad federal government forcing companies it. Thats think authoritarian wrong. company sent 2 emails essentially saying get vaccinated GTFO Almost connection.

I assume place makes news right place covid surging also hotbed vaccine and/or mask rejection. Force meaning federal government going fine private companies complying. still going US haha Workplaces 100 employees aren’t private. run small business home, rule doesn’t apply you.

Roads aren’t private either. don’t wear seatbelt car parked driveway.

Hey man, point guy behind curtain. know best interest heart? /s Latest Pfizer aiming data submission end year, approval “in first half 2022.” takes bit abstract understanding. *just* single person. construct billions individual cells working together like machine.

The 75% number never hard metric, number thrown possible number effective herd immunity. Since realized herd immunity possibility, we're going dealing cases long haul. 

Also cute think people still wearing masks walk grocery store, spend minutes see mask compliance toilet, especially high transmission risk venues like restaurants, bars, entertainment venues. 

Luckily due high vaccination status, death rate throughout Delta surge moved slightly throughout surge cases, basically removed restrictions Spring. Vaccines that, spotty mask compliance limited venues, cities.

Second command KBV Stephan Hofmeister said crude comment Spahn causes lot trouble doctors offices doctors flooded people want booster arent egligible. Doctors offices follow STIKO advices dont booster anyone. Doctors offices dont capacity booster anyone regards closed vaccination centers.

Ärztepräsident Klaus Reinhardt also mentioned general practitioners booster people according STIKO recommendations. reasonable booster healthy young people, evidence that, said.

Kassenärzte-Chef Andreas Gassenwarned blind actionism.

STIKO leading committee vaccine questions since decades germany. Blind actionism agitation population threaten disregard medical evidence good practise, which, IMO bit rediculous. STIKO need weeks gather good evidence recommend boosters reasonable. meantime need vaccinate high risk groups, take lot time aswell.

Personally never impression US. We're uniquely troubled country. 
However, important note lot people impression (myself included) achieving like 80% + vax rate meant *defeating* Covid-19. Vaccine makers actually never made claim though. messaging vaccine public lot mess ups.

which links vaccines great preventing reasons instituted measures, need measures?

Short answer: really don't. long risk sufficiently managed overload medical system.

The backlash see dropping Covid measures though due part messaging error.

In countries like US though vaccine Covid measures also heavily politicized. 
So entirely dislike Christian Fundamentalist, Pro-vax Pro Covid measures ""tribe"" takes new scientific facts understandings conflict narrative attack. 

I example, definitely still advocate everyone getting vaccinated, least 2-doses 2-dose vaccine is, see see sufficient evidence **everyone** needs booster. also think need enforce masks anymore.

Really doesn’t make sense. It’s rapture, nobody made cut.  7 day average October 25 70,291. Yesterday 72,788. inaccurate say cases rose slightly last week. Still case numbers stagnated pretty high 7 day average. winter season new Delta offspring slowly start take US cases due increased infectiveness next months. Cases likely hit valley start rise coming weeks. guidance vaccines still scarce. reasoning people recovered last 90 days probably protected could wait people could get vaccinated.

That said, based first principles immunology, 60-90 day “rest period” would expected generate stronger broader immune response.

However, aren’t clear numbers protection varies recommendation get vaccinated soon practical recovery. think Netherlands new one.

Antivaxxers say whatever want anything choose to. implementing policy save lives worried intellectually dishonest people stupid. Especially **true** anti-vaxxers far between. matter, one dies shot... blood loss ensues go well. every person US caught covid exactly once, expect around 100,000 coincidental deaths within 2 weeks catching it

Eh, Covid generally takes longer 2 weeks kill people medical care.

It take two weeks exposure start feeling symptoms, any. could take week symptoms person's condition deteriorates enough admitted ICU. Then, ventilation, O2, intubation could take another weeks succumb virus. 

Of course, also cases virus hit hard fast people died within days symptoms/ hospitalization hits everyone differently, people takes time.

Spanish Flu back 1918 killed horrifyingly fast, partially burnt quickly. person could wake feeling totally fine, start feeling sniffly lunch, get full fever 5pm, drown fluids multiple organ failure midnight.  work Fortune 500 chemical company corporate office officially stated go mandated vaccine weekly testing anyone not. already plant warehouse level. employees contractors enter site without vaccination card negative test 24 hours before. Make sense one positive onsite shutdown whole production maintenance/safety teams cause millions lost production even safety issues. 

We also medical clinics downstairs corporate plant levels testing reporting HR via internal system.

Seems waiting mandate via OSHA fully implement working towards ready announce mandate. vaccine killed them! S/   feel weird yet history mandates examples get supreme court. Read interpretation constitution Justice John Marshall Harlan. Yep idiot antivaxers endlessly say normal deaths. pneumonia! vaccine killing people! fucking tired shit. Winter Colorado North Dakota Idaho Montana? control poverty? Seems like obvious common cause.  Nope. hopefully reduce cases deaths spring break. Even first wave children fully vaccinated (two weeks second shot) well Christmas superspreader season, unfortunately. first potential outbreak pandemic got going earnest year later reported [Kansas military waiting announcement.
Although we'll see rubber meats road one. There's lot employers interest enforcing see lot fraud occurring avoid enforcing it.
But definitely see mandates effective. one testing option well might less effective, impending Dec 8th date federal contractors, [I believe, driven increase hope announcement allow bump continue near end year top additional bump kids providing starting right now. Obviously tenth percent day move needle fast, better nothing. ~~Do mean SRAG?~~ so, majority 700k confirmed COVID (70-90%). 2021, number Unspecified SRAG cases 40k.

Edit: realized meant lol.   Probably “lost 10 million people” part might’ve exaggerating.  That’s bit stretch. haven’t seen data estimates seriously suggests anything close many orders magnitude difference. It’s also probably ridiculous enough number doesn’t pass reality check.

Anecdotal don’t know single person gotten Covid China, anyone I’ve talked to.   whole family. space year convinced fucking idiots. hurts say it, point thing left makes sense.  like move, based metrics (number cases). Compared rest Texas, Dallas County pretty low case numbers y’all think get herd immunity end year?  Fuck feelings. use antibiotics viruses. Maybe get associated pneumonia though? I'm sure, pneumonia caused bacterially, literally caused covid exploding alveoli, however, build fluid lungs prime real estate secondary bacterial infection sure.

One biggest causes death survived first 24 hours Spanish Flu Cytokine Storm, secondary bacterial pneumonia took advantage victims weakened immune system lungs already badly damaged initial viral illness. 70% population fully vaccinated, 70% adults. coworkers estimate number people died COVID-19 likely close zero

I experienced dealing public. always ask they've working home public. isolated physically media bubble. course, seeing deaths seem real. deal death certificates line work. week went vaccine seeing 1-2 week listing COVID cause death. real tragic. Yeah, one vivid memories grade school getting polio vax. pleasant all. waited long line gymnasium it. couple kids fainted. Nice, Florida dad get booster appointment canceled, wonder that’s what’s happening well now. that’s good thing though vaccines going arms never Yea countries purposely reporting like India Russia China. countries simply means like developing countries. totally makes sense  Spanish Flu mainly affected younger healthier people time, saying 1890 Russian Flu play part, people died either children born 1890 pandemic. least 2 3 Gottleib current state things:

This theatrical bullshit designed pull heartstrings ridiculous. Yup, that’s exactly everyone thought mortality rate much higher early on. Turns virus isn’t nearly deadly thought. 5yo Pfizer trial. got unblinded turns fully vaxxed June! So, AMA needed? Spanish Flu hit younger people far, far harder normal influenza, still killed even older people.     No, factually wrong. stated international health committees advocate mask wearing. simple math, vaccination rates arent high enough incidences high. Dont wear mask then, dont claim based science. sure downvotes I'm boat. feels like gigantic government reach. also feels like something 100% necessary point. best easiest way bring pandemic end high vaxx rates. sad we're point seems *only* option get now. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

50-100 million 50 million range.

5-17 million 12 million range. Better medicine big part it. majority deaths 1918 flu directly, pneumonia caused. Basic antibiotics could saved millions.

The *other* thing made lethal ""W"" shaped spread. now, people refused 'told' wear masks social distance. assumed since cases deaths waning pandemic over, returned normal life early, got chance rage again. deaths came end, I'm afraid could repeat that. 5yo fully vaxxed June (she Pfizer trial). side effects, degree thought suggested placebo group.  I'm curious impact supply lines. seems anywhere 5-15% people quitting due mandates. That's significant part workforce. KFC vending machine!  Depends nobody does. Depends country are. area sustained drop. 

It's large country; regional. populated regions fall right now, driving US numbers.     kinda agree. don’t really want employer able this. Even though got vaxxed immediately put kid vaccine trial (she’s unblinded fully vaxxed since June btw).

But makes resent anti vaxxers -more-. people done right thing begin with, wouldn’t position government corporations could power this. Rite Aid updated scheduler too, appts soon Monday available near SW got lot problems workforce right now. ain't vaccines. wear one situations indoors work, say worn one since May period (when NY lifted mandates). still required state-owned buildings, unfortunately covers now. Hopefully gets lifted soon.   remain unvaxxed. They're gonna put extra testing, find new job company want deal testing.

That's big secret- actually full vaccine mandate, many private companies making one. Companies sick dealing covid needed government step boogeyman.   Thanks this. never knew name this. bad can't accept people's decisions.  people downvote anything here, probably covid deniers. people also downvote comments, suggest non-pharmaceutical measures like mask wearing. think vaccinated measures used. wrong, health authorities stand behind measures considering rising incidences europe e.g. europe. kind nobrainer, spend time indoors infections becomre likely. theres community want measures considering vaccines, often get downvotes consider otherwise.   decided masks remind people personal responsibility get vaccinated.

And suddenly:
No lethal accidents, cancer, murder. Nothing. dead people.

/s  Fuck 'em. exact narrative see antivaxxers push time 100% false. vaccinated transmit virus become sick covid. However, MUCH LESS INFECTIOUS whilst vaccinated MUCH LESS prone severe disease.     Germany still divided East West sociological terms lot issues, including vaccination. check link, see cluster states East vaccination rates low mid 60s cluster states West vaccination rates low mid 70s. vaccinated state (Bremen; 78.5% population fully vaccinated) West whereas least vaccinated state (Saxony, 56.9% fully vaccinated) East. Trust government lack thereof, likely historical reasons, plays huge role this. See reply job always ""That's counted covid inflate numbers."" really winning stupid conspiracy theorists. This. This. This. Obviously apply ineligible vaccination though seems true SW AA airlines back-tracked mandates. think ""high winds"" DFW caused many flight cancellations. wonder many people I’ll lose company setup tents unvaccinated

You suggested setting tents particular group people. Triage setting tents overrun health services. ill COVID unvaccinated (just vast majority), breakthrough cases exist, proper triage going care unvaccinated is. proper triage presumably begin max capacity within hospital reached.
 guess im dark punishment then, dont think unvaccinated deserve privilege quality experience vaccinated... Doesnt matter wouldnt happen anyway. Got it, thanks. Thats obviously true. mrna spike proteins limited within vaccination doseage nothing left hours vaccination, whereas live virus resplicate many weeks, many orders magnitude compared vaccination. Antivaxxers claim one wild thing another. Every day new madeup stuff. recommend fact checking websites:

There lot fact check websites there, find many ""alternative news sources"" getting debunked, impossible discredit invent new ones every even more, stopped one point.

One complicating factor excess deaths concept learned name ITT: ""mortality displacement,"" also called ""harvesting effect."" Basically, deaths happened may happened anyway later time. spike might partially offset dip future.

I'm sure explain deaths. even them. possible we'll eventually see bit compensatory dip coming months/years.

Another factor mentioned elsewhere kind opposite. limited flu season last year, due masks. reduced number flu deaths. absence COVID, would expected dip. actually saw spike instead. Meaning, COVID probably caused even deaths ""excess deaths"" would suggest... make lack flu.   love 10% suited vaccination all. Tennessee legislature like this. 

Good. No.
Even study Clinical studies indicated patients severe COVID–19 exhibit delayed weak adaptive immune responses;

And vaccines protect severe covid19.  Incorrect. ""politic"" pandemic, killed 750,000-1,000,000 citizens, sociopaths. OK, maybe last moment unfair. Republicans sociopaths... lot companies - dealing 1k+ tests week better 1k+ employees    got vaccine today, $100 NC. Could used it, tablet broke yesterday bought new one today. Ridiculous. Corruption finest. course “I VaCciNatEd EveRyBoDy is. MorOn” crowd insists there’s nothing hesitant double vaxxed mandates. Vaccines reduce spread, stop it. 
They reduce severity lot people still get called break covid. Yeah, happened America. amount times tripled even quadrupled ICU astounding. Doubled CRRT TTM. 

The delta surge unreal, made lot nurses (myself included) second guess continue field. wasting effort trying construct logical arguments attempt convince people long since decided abandon logic?

Nobody reasonable thinks ""satanic connections"" vaccine, nobody genuinely going change time soon.  incentive place everyone today literally first day kids. They're clarifying children qualify incentive everyone else. see issues this. People need get themselves.

This applies everybody, even fully remote. large number employees already covered directives around health care workers think part essentially treating everybody same. suspect want deal administrative nightmare keeping track testing. might actually one upsides At-Will employment.

We also large number MDs board directors C suite positions think also plays decision. Surprisingly corporate America, lot policies around work since Feb 2020 actually based best available evidence medical expertise. worked office since March 2020 pretty much everybody 100% since then.

I see problem masking indoor settings longer reduce transmission.. hospitalizations, deaths... transmission. moment CDC agrees. NYC agrees too, even forcing strongly recommend wearing face covering much possible people indoor setting home, even 6 feet distance maintained.  hope one work will, see OSHA violations already occasion. ""artificial parasites"" ""creatures tentacles"" still there, right? Along 5G. 50 people companies included this, that's entire company, apply you. Otherwise, report away Yep. Luciferin luciferase make fireflies glow.

Most wacky claims vaccines total fabrications; rather, they're based badly garbled true facts taken context.

My favorite: ""The vaccine contains/causes AIDS"".  

Not true currently authorized vaccines, one vaccine candidates actually contained protein HIV triggered false positives HIV tests. 

Now gets big **What Thinking?!?!?!?** apparently HIV (the virus causes AIDS) so-well studied biomedical researchers see toolbox rather dread pathogen.  vaccine developers took protein HIV use molecular clamp hold spike protein. protein going cause AIDS, ended triggering production antibodies protein, result trial participants started testing positive HIV antibody tests.  vaccine candidate abandoned shortly discovered.

See: Yep...thank service, btw...Safety paramount indeed. I'm HR Director, yep, I'm concerned turnover, would considerable.

Stay Safe, friend. PM want sidebar discussions next days. doubt that. companies care. also follow department defense guidelines too. I'm staying away that. Lol   Yeah I’m means expert. I’m 10 year safety profession veteran, obviously new us. obviously every company take varying level risks regards compliance ETS standards. know roughly 55% vaccinated worksite, company would hard pressed replace 45% refuse, especially local halls empty are. Mine low too. work big store, people rabidly vaccine. hope gets enforced proof presented. worry crazy customers. Hopefully last time Apple remove masking requirement. Netherlands wear masks Saturday due rise hospitalizations. One workplaces both. vaccinated still catch COVID, spread it, chance vaccinated catching substantially lower unvaccinated. risks two groups pose equal. seems like concession, consider cost logistics administering, tracking, testing reporting tests (not mention auditing procedures) massive financial penalty disguise. be, considering costs unvaccinated impinge society. second saw Luciferase, thought ""sometimes scientists fucking stupid. *always* name thing latin roots."" Naming light bringing/glowy enzine LUC-iferase going consequences, guys. Yes, agree first scenario. would qualify 100% outdoors, cases like construction. Unfortunately, construction involve job trailer, training, crew trucks qualify ""indoor periods"" eyes OSHA. takes one week make employee non-exempt. opinion, first glance 490 pages. Work blue collar environment 50 people. Probably 10 us vaccinated. Manager going around telling people enforce office openly telling guys get fake cards show him. worth pointing vaxed. Anyway, I'm probably gonna report sly first thing Jan 4th OSHA HR. He's good boss sure bad person. two people covid right btw. hope so. curious see rules around sort verification vaccine status required self-attestation enough. company put response yet. pro-vaccination. would 100% make argument employees share vehicles, access “work trailers” engaged building enclosed structures would exempt.

Your correct though. Page 350 explicitly lays guidance construction workers makes distinction. charge would make argument vast majority field employees exempt. Chronic post infection symptoms really hard characterize one challenging parts medicine. Can’t base societal decisions that.

I think vaccine mandates quite reasonable generally support them. masking mandates, high rates vaccine, make sense. Yes, April 18. Yeah, first facepalmed seeing title. then.. Bloody hell, there's really interesting trivia story. speak situation ground nyc. mask requirements since spring except subway. 70% fully vaccinated. Hospitals fine. Mortality fine. else people want ? Ha. reading chart wrong, looking Massachusetts. right. hope gets clarified next gubernatorial election. impression companies offering time vaccinations? 

My company gives us free day get shots, got extra time reason wait 5 minutes CVS get shot.  course airmen hit deadline first. face, army guys. imagine, one day researcher says ""hey, think use luciferase test!""

A year later, millions people refuse vaccine decision LMAO old company threw away favorite office chair meet OSHA regulates. Depends location, places mandates.  one April right? opinion, consequences defying mandate would severe military. Get shots, losers*.

 
 
 


*Obviously actual medically-exempted people aren’t losers here. shove “religious exemption” arse. need inspect anything this. tell company submit vaccination records every employee. check database find fraudulent entries. easy actually complied. Page 350 ETS. Makes clear point coworkers experience indoor periods described, means exempt. Even spend significant time outdoors. Trust me....this would help company tremendously could use exemption, nope. Think rainy mornings, tailgate talks, safety orientation, site orientations.

I still seen absolute proof, try open minded understand sides argument, seems still proof made real difference current way masks implemented.

If , please link it, studies seen far FAR scientific. Yes. lots people, long pandemic started. Doctors, nurses, painters, food workers, name few.



(As side note, work mandated uniform bothers 10 times mask.) think caught - recently Indonesia one lowest rates lung cancer &amp; COPD despite one worlds largest per capita cigarette sales.

I have! 

Only 1/4 people Tokyo metro I've seen wear masks (prior COVID19) never mandated government. Instead, people decided worth risk wear mask not.

The beauty lack mask mandate mean masks illegal, means people make risk calculus works them.  you’re likely catch sitting 50 feet away tables

Moderna’s booster considered “3rd shot” half vaccine amount never 2nd shot J&amp;J one dose. dr approved get Moderna shots mixing matching allowed. perfectly valid reasons happening, mean anyone bad job developing vaccines, vaccines ""failing"".

These baby steps, they're better alternative.  Love it. updates healthy adults allowed get booster? legal expert, US traditionally pretty solid upholding vaccination mandates long now. related specific situation, even Amy Coney Barret bother giving challenge vaccine mandate time day. 

The shaky arguments get trotted COVID vaccine mandate terrible outrageous vaccination requirements fine hold water far see. There’s difference promoting mandating. 

Promoting seatbelt use vs. cops able pull give ticket wearing seatbelt.

Promoting safe practices renovating homes vs. requiring homeowners apply pay $1,000+ building permit put back yard fence. 

There’s heck lot things government could mandate would make country much better/safer/prosperous place. *can*, doesn’t mean *should*. 

The government known overstep boundaries many occasions. one instances? Maybe, depends ask. think is. unreasonable surface, sure, problem timeline could set motion months ago, windowed around keeping workflow going unimpeded Christmas.

Now I'll give optimistic view ""No one lose job close Christmas"", that's optimistic view I'm willing have. core really reeks ""I know started talking months ago, want big corps lose MUCH money keep employees safe deadly disease"". recent uptick vaccinations almost entirely due booster shots unfortunately, look nytimes data: Saturdays rapid test one matters. Every time outbreak shut things eliminate it. would pretty obvious failed. one going shut things for. 

With enough vaccination could probably move endgame. They've given something like 2 billion inactivated doses. probably enough. worst thing outbreak far biggest vaccine producer would stop exporting several months give population doses.  hold months excess third doses everywhere likely mRNA third doses everyone. daughter made history. Many grateful.  See, that's thing.

That's \_just\_ cost test. 

There also hidden costs. Someone order ensure there's enough tests inventory. means procurement shipping receiving involved. Then, someone gets administer test. Someone ship processing. Someone receive review results. Data stored. paper records, there's cost associated that. electronic, there's developer time add fields HRIS systems

The labor costs associated processing $120 test could easily double cost test, more. force meaning... we're going work unless company vaccinated. That's government's choice, get choose work with. companies deciding force employees get vaccinated. Get fuck bullshit nonsense. I’m glad workers standing asking proper wages, something ago.

Booster - felt shitty day after, slept lot, arm hurt worst ever hurt shot. Feel good today (2 days after) though government interest promoting health safety population. altruism, health safety populace directly related productivity populace, therefore economic prosperity nation.

Let's look seatbelts. Seatbelts proven reduce injuries deaths motor vehicle accidents. Injuries cause loss productivity. Deaths remove workers entirely. ripple effects families injured dead, affect national economic prosperity. additional anecdote, local EMS provider area saying rollover accidents. two kinds people rollover: wearing seatbelts, dead.

The argument goes building codes vaccine mandates.

Regulations written blood, blood hurt killed unregulated practices. There's enough blood spilled Covid. almost loudmouths threatened quit that, loudmouths.  company work currently testing every unvaccinated person around 1250 people(were 72% vaccination rate). test cost $120 spending around $150,000/week test.   federal contractors.

This every company employs 100 people more. Mine saying comment rule released. 100% confidence going enforced, going say anything could pass blame directly OSHA. Zero-Covid ruleset compatible long-term stability prosperity. perfectly reasonable trade make vaccines, may still best option *right now,* population widely vaccinated, cannot norm forever. 

If randomly putting millions people lockdown regular basis, stifle social economic development. People afraid travel fear stuck far home without warning, willing risk opening new businesses randomly shut sometimes. happens Chinese New Year, example, kill small restaurant due loss expected profit, even government provides support pay wages rent.

By cutting foreign travel, close world. yes, enforcing two-week quarantine international arrivals effectively ""cutting foreign travel."" Foreign business want invest long-term difficult get see investments doing.

I suspect Chinese leadership made calculations, approach governance communicate clear unambiguous message, room interpretation. means even have, e.g. specific level vaccination mind, may communicate public, want public go along current ruleset is, without risk ""slacking"" get closer goal line. unrealistic?  adding on: OSHA regulates lot things protect employees’ bodies. Noise exposure, ventilation, hazardous chemical safety, etc. [It’s long list plenty examples. workplace (~5800 employees), vaccines mandatory 3 weeks ago. requirement caused ~700 employees get vaccinations already 90% vaxxed time. mandates work, ask me.     
We less 200 employees submit religious medical exemptions (i think 40 medical exemptions approved). others told could come work health safety protocols gave 60 days keep benefits mull over. think going happen company finds one unvaxxed employees contracted covid caused company lose money personel quarantine get tested?.

That guy/girl/x get fired say 'vaccine' probably even lucky doesnt get sued. 

At least country, dno USA labour laws.

Companies wont continue put shit people will.  guess actual unwilling employers common people actually willing lose jobs this.

Why? there’s kids like daughter included trial data. deciding factor doctors vaccine worked 12+ individuals who’d already vaccinated condition her.

Pretty sure fast tracked Supreme Court immediately struck down. honestly believe mask mandates us rest lives.

I'm losing patience all. masks since beginning, limiting vectors exposure possible. grocery store business people wearing masks? Yes. nightclubs business people wearing masks? I'd say no. 

There's limit long ask certain businesses shut down, vaccination helps limit transmission severe outcomes, make trade-off keep bars nightclubs going business, expense possibly bit transmission. Since goal zero COVID, seems make sense: Add extra layers protection limit transmission detrimental business, accept higher risk detrimental.

It's like memes ""Oh, guess COVID goes away restaurants sit table"". No, let's say someone table asymptomatic transmissible COVID. mask walking bathroom, less chance infection tables walk others bathroom, accept risk tables around chance infection. limiting vectors possible. think FDA taking time that. guess is, last weeks probably tied vaccine approvals boosters children. explanation timeline, whether agree Yep, like flu, people believe Covid 19 turn into.

It would help unvaccinated people would stop creating mutations like Delta.   doctor's associations agreed it, though, current vaccination directive already allow it.

Why? 150 employees would problem enforcing mandate Would ever describe 10% workforce limited number?

No, course not.

It say. like answer. live? seems extreme. looking for.

So far Coca-Cola might smallest, 8,500 employees, mandate vaccine. course they're offering $2,000 employees held out.  pseudo-locking unvaxxed wont help. Current transmission among vaxxed people keep exponential growth going.

We past point easy reach. overreach are.  love it. Take stupid claims destroy science.

Too bad science part conspiracy trust people deemed masks ""better nothing"" we've backed corner. Outside healthcare settings (including LTC SNFs), way they're used places around country still mandates outlandish.

The people fearful catching COVID still wear regardless requirement not.

Aside stupidity it, absurd leaders continue use executive orders issue mandates guise COVID real emergency anymore. Show evidence STIKO needs reforms. clear said easy show.

The problem purely political Bremen vaccination rate 81,2 % whereas Saxony 59,1 %. Spahn wants divert shortcomings like mask affair. Dropping mask mandate schools, lowest vaccinated group os rediculous, opening much quickly bite us but, closing vaccination centres also offering low access options, informing 70+ via letters get boosters, giving access air cleaners schools, double standards allowing personal freedoms work places, issues. Requiring sound scientific data recommend bosster shots isnt one them. ploy divert.  know. rooting Worldometer tho.  let's honest here, anti-vaxxers file complaints non-compliant businesses really compliant make people waste time/resources.

Israeli data clear, ignored far long. exactly people claim religious exemption vaccine? They've manufacturing vaccines ages. developing one home celebrated. Hopefully keep advancing capabilities, Covaxin's inactivated vaccine tech decades old. newer vaccine tech like viral vector vaccines, even newer mRNA vaccines harder develop. Surely predictable? Europe hits US again? Hopefully enough vaccinated/ boostered limit hospitalisations / death. Funny ask. I’ve spoken vast majority 25 unvaccinated employees have. Every one I’ve spoken said they’d get vaccine mandated it.. wanted share company name would have. :)  smaller companies going comply though. may able go somewhere non-compliant. may able go somewhere less 100 employees depending job skills.

Will serious issue Covid-19? Depends virus scientific policy response pandemic. think depends go. know someone provide proof occupational setting. starting plateau.

Again depends where.  Every single report last 3 weeks Fulton county zipcode double digit drops previous 14 days. Republicans religious people. 4-5 people team un-vaxxed. Two got shot though one extremely angry pissed it. two looking medical exemptions. Neither medical reason beyond ""it's safe"" we'll see goes.  Right, federal government get telling restaurant work refrigerate food cooking it? know that's handout Big Refrigerator. govt failed us miserably. step taken long ago. busy opening discos lifting mask mandates school. Mostly Germany Russia. others added Netherlands. 

I’m sure level vaccination country Europe. also lot 100-500 person companies understand risk covid causing percentage workers time weeks glad mandate complaints blamed government employee can't quit since every comparable job requirement.   healthcare. Exibit A: 2 neighbors... anti-vax point verbally assaulting others getting theirs. 2 months ago pleaded lives admitted hospital Covid. 2-faced cowards. I've noticed one thing people loudly objecting vaccine mandate company, they're exactly high performers. Omg is. Can't believe changed mind turned dog shit. Wow. Current transmission rates 53 European countries “grave concern” new cases nearing record levels, exacerbated transmissible Delta variant virus, WHO’s Hans Kluge told media briefing.

Quite terrifying considering there's 44 countries Europe.  Biden's mandate feds federal contractors vaccine testing option. know OSHA's softer. guess depends county, pull survey information (for free) ensure I’m encroaching neighbor’s property. 

I don’t need pay someone else hundreds+ homework me. lies, SARS-NCOV-3?  Agreed, rather crawling factory looking compliance machinery forklifts ladders pallets racks and.... walk hit low hanging fruit hour. Grab fines, move next business.

Don't know fines help pay OSHA employees, would easy enough do. right flying corpse injuring another person SHALL infringed! company announced deadlines around yesterday all-hands along announcing allow testing option.

Looking slack comments, really surprised learn many experts immunology constitutional law work company. one single person know complaining See, *good* thing feel weird it. means we're lying everything peachy, recognize there's major conflict two core values (public good wanting limit power gov/corporate us), values 100% valid. recognize things rarely black white world, see resulting shades gray. Nice! thank you! Misinformation dangerous. Canadian in-laws legitimately believe q-anon conspiracy theories COVID19 won’t get vaccinated. MIL autoimmune disease drugs too. They’re far gone de-program. work share experiences public forum worried others commenting replying someone whos personality apparently revolves around lack mask, I'll take compliment. Continue fucking yourself.  I'm actually little worried one likely continue see published safety results. works disrupting enzymes covid uses reproduce, inserting errors enzymes genetic makeup. I'm little leary that, lack open data helping there. company enforcing see consequences... Pisses Brazil high number cases whole pandemic. add natural infection numbers vaccines, probably get high immunituly overall. ‘Harvesting’ effect messes method, due Covid affecting elderly comorbidities badly, people might statistically died time period might offed covid, death percentage doesnt change year, ultimate cause death changed. Yes AZ trigger stronger immune response, fact mounts ten times antibodies Covaxin, yet doesn’t anything efficacy. Looks like getting first look OSHA mandate states. Im interested watch plays out. think probably dubious legal footing, especially requiring employees pay testing get vaccine company size limit. lawsuits fun watch. 

What suspect happen people get vaxxed assuming emergency temporary injunction - plays gets killed kept everybody already shot.  lot Eastern Europeans Austria. Every single time I've heard anti-vaxxer interviewed they've Eastern European accent.  bad luck initial Delta wave delayed month two compared to, say, United Kingdom, variant hitting population enjoying low case numbers less restrictive measures happened occur right weather got shitty everyone went back inside gather.

Two factors here, it’s Delta plain old seasonality.

Keep mind though rolling weekly average however still thousand short hitting December-2020 peak – extraordinarily high case number reported singular Wednesday likely contains good chunk retroactively published infections November 1st, bank holiday.  Says guy deletes old comments. lol Almost certainly true. We'll able determine rearview mirror comparing world year-on-year death rates.

I'm sure republicans attribute economy god's wrath evil spirits something. Seems intentional 
Again I'll say seems like free, easy performance evaluation round layoffs selfish foolish percent staff. downside overall stubborn people flooding labor market eventually going bankrupt becoming burden society one hires them. I’m sure you’re seeing China “massively” undercounting vs US death tolls numbers accurate. linked graphics undercounted similarly - honestly expected far undercounting China based narratives characterization Reddit.

The sinophobia nuts.  Deletes hundreds comments calls someone else odd. Okies. Whereas checking distribute antiscientific claims understandable imo. kinda proven point, frightened hot takes feel like need delete them. good one.  totally going fix supply chain issues /s know county stopped testing corpses coroner whatever keep numbers down. I’m surprised millions people died COVID remain untallied.  I'm you. think options. tried telling people right thing. work. sort tried carrot work. we're left stick.  There's work getting Covid treatments even vaccines pill form, that's still ways away. wait? injection already effective, concern microchip bullshit, says can't pill too? patience Coloradans wearing thin keep wearing masks protect 20% folks haven’t taken simple step protect themselves,” governor said briefing reporters.

My emotional reaction rational side also knows cannot abandon 20%. stupidity left unchecked break nurses, doctors, hospitals, healthcare general. Think less protecting 20% protecting access healthcare. ICU's clogged, worse car accident. need non-emergency procedures, going worse wait extra 4 weeks burned staff quit. Oh... premiums, insurance premiums already going skyrocket, even worse 20% die hospital stiff hospital bill. people drowning really care drag too. ignore peril. one thing that's worth road trip, able.

Great news. terrifying—I’m sorry hope kid gets better soon. 3.5 year old you’re currently living nightmare.   I’d rather vaccine mandates, don’t think choice many people didn’t care. Never thought like makes sense. I’m shocked people pissed cooperations looking bottom line workers refusal get simple vaccine.  would also prevent overwhelming majority COVID-19 deaths hospitalizations. absence virus extinction, I'll certainly take that.   find job lets test weekly. They’ll get it.  countries must work harder prevent the coronavirus from spreading deaths new cases surge, World Health Organization’s Europe head said transmission rates 53 European countries “grave concern” new cases nearing record levels, exacerbated transmissible Delta variant virus, WHO’s Hans Kluge told media must change tactics, reacting surges Covid-19, preventing happening first place,” region saw 6% increase new cases last week nearly 1.8 million new cases, compared week before. number deaths rose 12% period.
If region follows current trajectory, Kluge said, another 500,000 Covid-19 related deaths could occur region February next year.
“Today every single country Europe facing real threat Covid-19 resurgence already fighting it.” don't. want around nasty SARS plague breath getting us. Love Ford.    far, ceo Pfizer, head cdc, FDA saying early 2022, like Q1 Vax rate lower basically NE states.

Our neighbors also good clip lower. Husker Texan comes visit, they're going spreading Boston guy NYC.

Additionally think we've hit less hard throughout course pandemic NE unvaccinated vulnerable NE. Especially post-COVID. Colorado summers mild everyone heads outside. think that's prevalent NE. can't even find place near vaccine yet. pediatrician says call back 2-3 week local pharmacies now. get first dose Best way weed crazies instead HR interview Best wishes family, sucks. sequence got slammed it, peak slightly less intense 2nd Pfizer shot, put fever 105.1 (and normal 97.6 instead 98). Moderna got 104, crappiness lasted 18h compared 12h Pfizer. (Note full dose; lied way one saying immunocompromised mix match allowed also ""forgot"" vaccine card.)

IIRC study Israel said 20% felt worse booster, rest felt less bad. triple Pfizer; there's guarantee switching would saved worse time. depends where. states mask mandate. mandate mask vaccinated (but nobody checking it). states mask mandate all. consensus it’s personal decision now, even place mask mandate, people go indoors without masks nobody cares. restaurant bars, say “masks actively eating drinking”, nobody wears one. 

The good news is, vaccinated people, catch Covid, it’ll like bad cold flu. it’s path normal. deaths hit new highs Romania Russia surge COVID-19 hospitalisations Austria expected tighten pandemic reported record high daily number 591 COVID-19 deaths Tuesday amid persistently low vaccination rate wave coronavirus infections overwhelmed country's ailing health care system.

I went CDC website. wrong.

I never get around correcting him. think he's far rabbit hole. lot misinformation sleeve. like ""greatest hits"" different conspiracy theories. Gonna start new year lot pissed unvaxxed.  Yes point even children vaccinated, mean pandemic over. help, reason restrictions never needed again.  source shows prior pandemic credible contributor 1918 mortality rates?

I impression 1918 flu deaths healthy young people suffered cytokine storms.  way connect charge people directly responsible sabotaging substantive response pandemic purposefully spreading misinformation? harvesting effect

Thanks comment. heard term before. also called ""mortality displacement."" There's whole Wikipedia article it. probably use term said, understand concept, clear properly analyze this. fraction COVID deaths would died exact time, absence COVID? about, many would died within next week? next month? Year? Five years? could imagine individual cases might apply. would add large number? I'd surprised.

But would even tell?

I guess could look historical deaths extrapolate based change population. there's margin error past deaths. months/years little less deaths. could see analysis getting messy, large margin error. assume ""deaths would happened anyway"" may spread several years, data years.  mother died September 2020. week two earlier, covid test came back negative.



She died due massive blood clots, likes doctor stated, ""it's one largest I've ever witnessed.



Sure, could completely unrelated. 66 best shape life. Prior getting ill, PA's restrictions mostly lifted; got hair cut nails done met friend two.



I think one minute drive thru test received accurate.



She avoided going hospital fear contracting covid. time went, late.



My mother absolutely excess death. Still small number grand scheme things think say wait 90 days treated monoclonal antibodies. anyone else, get vaccinated soon  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  can't used proof vaccines dangerous? Damn 17mil many people live Netherlands. could also ask FDA need fewer data come decision. demanding high quality data seen bad thing? would vaccine sceptics say approval given quickly rare side effects occur. Even today child death vaccination news german, trustworthy looked causation proven.)

Generally conclude one country another, Mertens words burden disease young generations higher america germany. also well known fact children lot less commonly affected severe covid infection, therefore data exceptionally good show smaller individual benefit. said ""both risks infection vaccination low"". Therefore nonpharmaceutical protections applied unvaccinated children, fact, RKI recommended time time again. politicians didnt want spend money air filters.
If goal reduce deaths, would follow WHOs advice get every human 1st 2nd doses. that. Even rich countries wouldnt care people poor countries, global perspective innoculating poor people would make sense reduce risk virus mutation. Yep, ""damn gubbermint again! do? Get vaxxed Friday fired."" Same. Achy, sore arm, tired, nothing close second shot. 
Get boosters 6 months second shot folks Seems unreasonable wait 95% vaccination risk severe outcomes healthcare strain reduced large degree moderate vaccination rates. don’t think ever get there. Sounds like vaccine didn’t stop spread appears reason previously infected people get two doses since immunity peaks first that’s good point Masking unneeded point high vaccine environments. wear masks asked required. vaccinated since February. Luciferace used test mRNA platform though - injected mRNA particles code luciferace mice various ways (intramuscluar, intravenus, etc.,) looked parts mice started One thing note vaccines rather different effects administered different routes. [Here's mouse study researchers Penn Acuitas (the Vancouver lipid company that's partnered Pfizer BioNTech vaccine), looking lipid nanoparticle mRNA injected several different ways (intradermally, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously). used RNA firefly luciferase marker convenience, inject mice later luciferin (the partner enzyme) look see light up. outside biomedical sciences, speaking completely literally. I’m guessing neither got seriously sick. 

If cold flu symptoms, vaccine solved it.   However, we’re testing unvaccinated large companies, going lot stop spread COVID. 

Not completely isolating first place. get go outside house public staying locked away everyone. 

Yeah, forcing people exposed people goes *long* way stopping spread.   time. effective preventing severe disease death reduce chances infection 100% effective. would need much effective vaccine keep zero Covid open borders.  I'm UK still wear masks work. Got Pfizer booster yesterday. went Pfizer previous ones well. First shot side effects. second shot, night chills body aches hot flashes made sweat arm hurt lot like 3 days. Well booster felt side effects actual fever 100. day 2 still feel really crappy, body aches stuffy nose also runny lol. Hope goes away soon! Kind wish chose Moderna though, maybe feel awful. Anyone else experience lot side effects?    lllooong…. Self-destructiveness classically linked imprudent risk-taking behaviors Fair. chance read actual mandate yet.  Someone gets infected dies company bye bye company.  going punitive damages knowingly ignoring OSHA rules. Coronavirus family nothing like Influenza family. got 95% people vaccinated, would definitely go away."
