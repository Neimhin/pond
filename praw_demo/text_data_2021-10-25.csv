0,2021-10-25," got first dose April (J&amp;J), moderna booster yesterday. mostly really sore arm day, sleep really late. couple hours later woke feverish massive headache. Currently mend I'm feeling lot better 16 hours later, fully there. 

For context, I'm fairly healthy 22 y/o male lolz....this best comment (and probably appropriate given lofty idea creating master vaccine COVs )\\ trolling, right? **Frameable quotes walls pharmaceutical companies:**

Yeah pharmaceutical companies businesses take advantage government research stuff, know this, true, topic particular? It’s FDA website. Look documents last week’s VRBPAC meeting. third dose effective compared first two first two compared unvaccinated. need bigger dose. Got turned away booster appointment even though J&amp;J shot first website said eligible. say they're seniors teachers now. anyone else experienced this? they’re fine. Exactly. New Zealand ended attempt Zero COVID policy. doubt China achieve it. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Forcing someone put something body weird. tried thing, get full dose Moderna 3rd dose. Right CDC approved half dose booster.

Moderna clearly best vaccine.  

So Moderna 100 mcg Pfizer 30 mcg.

What know half-dose compares.

Moderna 50 mcg vs Pfizer 30 mcg?????? 

To seems odd full dose Pfizer approved half dose Moderna approved.  Persuading unvacccinated people reason drop mask requirements. reason drop pretty much pointless vaccinated people compelling reason keep screwing lives. isn’t live. It’s pointless stupid. kids already unmasked eating. Eating outside (which school) makes way sense. kids wear masks perfectly day kids. going exposure. Drawing line talking lunch ridiculous.

“Just staying remote” option. students dread weekends school time structure, regular schedule, MEALS. kids get everything school. show nothing leave food, jacket, books bring home. worry kids leave afternoon I’m relieved see morning. “Just stay remote” right kids.  Vaccines don’t last long body, vaccine gone number weeks. Wife (30) (37) got Moderna boosters today Walmart! Birth rates declining nationally economic reasons. People feeling like can't kids later focusing career, student debt, etc.  similar threads searched posting believe they're trying go ""Zero COVID."" unvaccinated pay back! bringing specifically morons, he's concentrating stupid... sure. Def transient. 

Which best way describe florida saying America east coast, shit rolls hill. really shouldnt shocked, took forever Lancet remove Wakefield paper saying Vaccines cause Autism, even countless evidence false. Look, one safe path pandemic vaccinate 95% population.

There's even minuscule chance we're ever going get close vaccinating 95%. long want vaccinated/boostered be, gives shit anti-vaxxers. Thanks. Appreciate warnings well. I’m second generation, remember working waiter melting pot restaurants, people always asked from, would tell Pompano Beach, would shocked. always told never met real Floridian before. think that’s bit exaggeration, truly lot us. It’s incredibly transient state. Ha, memories, stupid stupid stupid roof demotion/repair 2nd dose.  Fine hours, followed 12hrs described body went war learning fuck shit up. next morning totally fine back roofing.

Was kinda surreal feeling ""Sick"" also much ""Not sick"" 


Can't imagine horrible would die COVID.  Oh jeez. open tab couple days ago, can't find it. seemed news articles. sure NIH data, fairly small study big differences clear way go. I'll keep looking...

It like 2 week antibody data, case studies death rates, clear.     also lay couch day playing video games (and bought new one) yeah pretty much same. Reading surprise all. live Ohio.

Went Sam's club Sunday needed things. parking lot *Full*. one empty spot pull in. took minutes navigate mess people cars get parking lot drive back home place pickup order next day.

95% people going coming store masks. We're still Delta spike moment. I’m third gen. Wife fifth gen. families hate what’s happening. think counting birth certificates death certificates. Census head count. lives neighborhood right now? Population decrease census could migration well death. actually perfect. lie needed.  scheduled ONLINE went CVS. one ever asked eligibility criteria questioned it.

They wanted give Pfizer since got earlier. Despite fact able schedule Moderna booster.

I told CDC approved mix match. tried act possible. asked - could please confirm CVS corporate policy this.

Then pharmacist lady went inside called boss something.

Finally came outside said - yes give Moderna - half dose. asked full dose possible, said - booster half dose. wonder would differences terms numbers Representatives state census year. interviews last week, several advisers Centers Disease Control Prevention Food Drug Administration said data show that, exception adults age 65, vast majority Americans already well protected severe illness need booster shots.

Translation: exception people like me, vast majority Americans already well protected severe illness need booster “These evidence-based recommendations,” said Dr. Sarah S. Long

Long, allegedly age 76, apparently wants wait lot people die (but elderly, course) making obvious “I don’t think evidence everybody groups needs booster today,” said Dr. Matthew Daley

Daley apparently feels evidence everyone needs booster groups, one groups needs them. interesting position, given undoubtedly 65-year olds need boost, yet seem little reservation decision. Susprisingly, Daley appears 65, perhaps justification immunocompromise, else get vaccine regardless official “The door got bigger bigger bigger, got wider wider step,” Dr. Offit added. “The companies got wanted, administration got wanted.”

Offit, age ~69, apparently horrified idea administration decided plan potential needing boosters sufficient evidence justify “The problem troubled don’t know boosters necessary,” said Dr. Cody Meissner

Wow Meissner, allegedly age 77, sounds everyone else comes Dr. Perlman said opposed boosters younger people first, voted favor reasons.

Perlman, allegedly age 73, maybe realized children something would want protected.  always thought Zero Covid vaccination. issue Zero Covid countries didn’t mandate vaccinations.  restaurant behavior drives crazy. recently MoCo restaurant band setting up, completely unmasked. another restaurant, couple masks on, entered seated staff right next table, even though many tables available. Thanks this. chance link study show effectiveness 50 mcg Moderna dose? downvotes? totally true. us actually true Florida Natives. New York, Canada, Cuba, Latin speaking country, Midwest. It’s fuckin imports problem, natives. Interesting. Thanks sharing experiences.

I experience side effects sore arm, 3 shots.

I'm guessing immune system response robust enough.  get Moderna booster? lie anything?

Not asking judgement, asking got 2 Pfizer want Moderna booster.  much hate Florida? DeSantis 0.4%, hardly think actions views represent people living there, actually live consequences. 2021 majority officer fatalities FL COVID one highest law enforcement death tolls year. 
Source: Desantis pro-COVID, killed many Florida police, Desantis needs more.....yet remains pro-COVID. Ok. details data? I'm thread little preliminary ""research"" booster want. found primary series, worth noting Phase 1/2 results, 250ug offer substantial improvement 100, cost unacceptably severe side effects. difference 25 100 even larger. Pfizer different levels 30 100, similar issue side effects worth them.

Then, comparing NIH antibody levels 100 mix match 50 Modernas booster trials, 100 seemed much higher. Moderna offered reasons comparison quite apples apples, refused disclose results P201A initial booster study directly comparing boosters.


So settled 50 good booster. Hooooooooly fuck, *this* story? Lol Doubtful since people remove masks crowded indoor restaurants bars. trending vaccination rates. sure link didn’t work, fixed now. don’t think much concern limit breakthrough data since scale same. We're mirroring happened India Delta hit spring. May spreading like wildfire gearing vaccinations anything near coverage Delta hit here. however Covid cases think 5% May. large degree burned cost lives nightmarish. good portion remaining 83% show effect. Craziness resulting 5 10 years behind bars. Wow- great journalism. Raimondo Secretary Commerce. Buttigieg Secretary Transportation. no.

The EUA Moderna booster 50 ug only.

Vaccines dose response curve drugs do. Sometimes smaller dose even creates bigger immune response. data Moderna submitted booster EUA showed little difference immunogenicity 50 ug 100 ug doses.

You can't assume different vaccines equivalent ug ug. position assigned based political credentials, medical ones. Oh, appolgies, may missed context message responding deleted.

Although worth noting countries suspended Moderna, mostly specific age groups, access Pfizer (which basically lower dose Moderna), stressed risk rate events higher covid. Plus research generally found Moderna effective, seem factored mentions went 5 states deaths births 2019 25 states 2020: mention cite source) Good. 

Hopefully anti maskers want act take notice. Keep hands bodily fluids yourself. Actually vaccine side effects become apparent within six weeks dosing, usually sooner that. left time immune memory, understood decades. 

On hand, many viruses cause illness begin years later- partial list includes mumps, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HPV, EBV, polio, varicella-zoster.  Thanks. got full dose booster Pfizer first two.

We see mixing matching produces higher antibody response - everything comes vaccines.

Long story short - data suggesting mix match approach best. much better still remains seen.

To answer question - think see much effective. Realistically J&amp;J vaccine vs mRNA vaccines great difference average person news outlets would lead believe - vaccines kept people hospitals great rate kept symptoms manageable.

I personally ""boosting"" J&amp;J part trial want results opine on. part J&amp;J trial would likely take mRNA booster. feel like regret getting J&amp;J booster feel like give great protection. Anyone vaccinated J &amp;J gets booster. questions asked answers irrelevant. part problem they're taking damn long process death certificates? update totals couple times per week, increasing something like 1000 time. could prepared. Try Walgreens, gave wife moderna booster, issues rationale making anyone vaccinared J&amp;J wait mRNA vaccine. shortages beginning year. making wait? CDC says now. Way 500 kids died worldwide, you’re making number up. PhD public health, though, published work field. makes even puzzling me, tbh. pleading citizens get vaxxed long ago? You’re eligible Moderna Pfizer booster shot. It’s good idea get it, difference you’re asking, marginal compared getting booster. really can’t lose. According article, info I'm reading people thread gone local place try get booster, get Moderna Pfizer booster (at least California) fit criteria:

* Anyone 65 older.
* adults age 18 64 cancer, dementia, diabetes, heart disease, HIV medical conditions increase likelihood Covid complications.
* Anyone 18 older live work long-term care facility, homeless shelter prison congregate setting.
* Front-line personnel 18 older higher risk Covid exposure due job, including first responders, teachers, supermarket staff mass transit employees.

It question medical health and/or side effects/danger/whatever. like vaccines came out, strictly rationing thing far tell, make sure higher risk people get first.

 natural immunity, certain EU countries accept EU green passes natural immunity 6 months, need vaccine. since US national vaccine passport track vaccination status previous infections, cause leadership right, way track natural immunity; honor system work cause plenty Americans chosen lie time time again. mentioned discussed again, debunked. Yet come blurt partial truths. 


Lastly, compare bullying airborne highly contagious virus killed millions globally, shows level ignorance tone deafness country. level ignorance reason country behind rest developed world recovery efforts. people like enabling behavior. False, allow exceptions.  booked Sunday night CVS.com, went afternoon got Pfizer boosters Queens, NY. Late 20s/Early 30s, J&amp;J shots back March, criteria needed. I'm concerned death rate, around 1.5 years nearing 5 million folks. precautions trivial impact compared tens -- perhaps hundreds millions -- people hole heart loss loved one. confirm, got J&amp;J, got Pfizer booster today, arm hurts like hell, worth it! Antibiotics problem. reasons vaccinate recent infection allergies. ask doctor, course. really shitty take. think next variant come from? 

Places low vaccination rates virus time spread amongst population mutate.  point. Lots New Yorkers retire Florida. Vaccines *extremely* effective preventing hospitalization. effective, individuals choosing get vaccinated getting sick admitted hospitals. placing unnecessary strain hospital resources placing unnecessary stress medical professionals. We're dire situation right there's need it. 


Example A: Bob immunocompromised could receive vaccine. Despite best efforts stay safe, Bob gets infected COVID must admitted hospital. hospital full capacity since many people *could* received vaccine chose so. Bob luck. RIP Bob. 


Example B: Mary received vaccine. Mary got car accident serious critical condition. hospital beds available Mary occupied individuals *could* received highly effective vaccine, chose to. Sorry Mary. Tough luck. 


I'm glad brought compassion. choosing receive vaccine deserve none. clogging hospitals, causing others receive reduced quality medical care, prolonging pandemic restrictions everyone. choices. goal comply executive order. vaccination good society. know endangered really vaccinate birds people  ...who kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders kept banging spreaders... lfg “Having child present like carrying wood burning house” shallower that. People care money assets days anything else saying matter weeks weeks :( Huh, sounds like anyone J&amp;J vaccine get first available mRNA booster turned show get booster. summary:

* I'm healthy 30 year old accountant (ie front line, etc), J&amp;J vaccine, 2 months gone by, eligible get mRNA booster. health, job, underlying conditions, age, none matter. get whenever want.
* I'm healthy 30 year old accountant, mRNA vaccine, 6 months gone by, currently eligible get mRNA booster seem ""saving them"" front line / risk / 65+.

Thanks input, hope understand I'm trying break balls ask dumb questions, I'm genuinely confusion based wording. scared masks? get stupidity Seriously, Coke giving bonus someone getting exemptions? idea get people right thing? New Zealand, US continues go downhill, come stay you? Pow.  Sign up. clear certain countries prioritized protecting science. meant people wear mask you’re going sex believe mistaken. googled first result CDC. looked incidence chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis. Basically showed durning initial shutdown, reported cases went down. Otherwise, same, maybe little more. Shocked tell you. SHOCKED!!! Ok. 
 
- Active participation study design day 1 partner, stakeholder
 
- clear communication of, pre-alignment on, outcome / efficacy thresholds approval
 
- transparent delivery analysis data real-time parties
 
- continuous alignment updating acceptable risk profiles side effects vs outcomes
 
- use 21st century statistical / AI technologies data analysis
 
Basically, working team - regulatory bodies industry - vs. ‘show got’ approach today. see, you’re saying sunlight blue? see point, also want unvaccinated kids public school worry yet. excellent protection hospitalization death. combo studied knowledge, see reason would much different two doses J&amp;J. agree you. article uk completely agree regarding us Yeah seems like collecting infinity vaccines ala Thanos, might easier. feel you, really do. daughter 3 CCHS - wait agonizing. Even release vaccines week, kids considered fully-vaxxed Thanksgiving. Christmas first chance unclenched family gathering lot people. get sick often really one. went doctor couple years ago ""establish relationship"" seemed kind annoyed considering nothing really wrong lol. guess could make random appointment someone.

Then see something like this: kinda validates position, idk. Ah yeah should’ve fact checked Facebook first, sorry *Looks window* gray, shittons rain. I’m hoping they’re ball submit least data within week 5-11 authorization. 2 days, October 28, month since submitted 5-11 data. dread learning long term effects COVID. Reduced lung function? Heart disease? could lot people experience disabilities earlier life. like 360 ICU beds entire country. system running 83% capacity.  realize group people panel treating it, front line Ask doctor Good you! got 3rd Phizer early side hoping see reports eventually whether holds tanks 6 months. I've always wondered this. much mask effectiveness influenced constant visual reminder mask change behaviours/distancing.  September Pfizer rep said data 5’s would follow 5-11 month. Pfizer submitted data 5-11 FDA September 28.

Then, suppose they'll delivering something next month approved around December January, maybe. [Pubpeer some. probably haven’t looked; appears paper hasn’t gotten much attention myocarditis one(which much commentary responses). total 9,786,082 doses administered Singapore national vaccination programme Oct addition, 239,146 doses vaccines recognised World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing, includes includes **Sinovac-Coronavac, Sinopharm** AstraZeneca, administered Oct 24, covering ** 122,126** sure subtraction least. know get idea. mostly used Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines.  Good soundbite. Could explain would look like would differ current process? feel two year old cancer thankfully active anymore well. We’ve locked since March 2020 crazy think about. excited twin cousins vaccinated finally play together. 5 approved. feel like you, maybe overly cautious it’s miracle she’s still us aren’t willing risk it. Thankfully she’s young realize what’s going isn’t normal. teach progressive SF Bay Area. Sure experience anecdotal, speak schools area. take precautions masks. We're strict though, except lunch, students mostly eat outside. work high school 3,000 kids hear single case every week so.

So either we're really lucky, masks working.

And record HATE teaching mask, wrecking voice, fun many hours, seem work love job.  I’m getting another dose Pfizer booster today. lot reading end felt like wasn’t anything conclusive regarding mixing vaccines improved immunity. 

Pfizer good me. I’m going stick it. believe it’s jehovah’s witnesses, lot rules medical treatments. vaccines all, members supposed get blood transfusions even 7 year old can’t wait shot (he hates shots though lol) said would get tomorrow could. That’s know kid ready see world! It’s going feel like huge weight shoulders kids vaccinated. totally understand! Let’s fuckkkiingg goooooo!!! freedums = virus five year old although kind sad asked wear mask school anymore. told hopefully next year wearing mask school. hard little kids, comes home wanting tell friend know color hair lol. medical exemptions know approved truly are. feel like lot would sudden issue 2000 paid day recovery table. 3 different products put allergies harder claim. like religious ones requiring crap minister, medical ones need questioning doctor. source horseshoe crab thing? looked found vaccines vegan tested animals mice macaque monkeys. date delta she’s dirty whore. fact people aren’t double bagging shame cause lot needless deaths. 

Additionally unvaccinated people literally got lives saved monoclonals vulnerable stupid understand reality bout covid short circuited. took severe covid set (which work best) vulnerable dancing delta again. interesting see spread coming schools it’s indicative lower vaccination rate area. wonder much selection bias. district mask rules likely town county lax rules population area takes virus less seriously, lower vax rates, etc.

Are kids getting suck lax mask rules school lax virus related rules around area? title forgot add crucial detail, 60 360 beds empty still. like thousands 60 empty.

Let's retitle say Singapore 15% ICU capacity left plans add needed. Pfizer.   Well kinda point, it? actual definition usually, depending source definition, something along lines ""everything surface earth, including atmosphere space that"", since space definitely blue, point stands even firmly. blue aspect sky perspective trick entirely depends time day viewer is, atmosphere that's acting prism give blue color, nothing actually blue constant continuous characteristic perspectives, typically like definitions apply broadest number perspectives possible, makes useful communicate clearly. Act collaborators rather gatekeepers.  right. didn’t think that. must reason schools higher numbers cases.  Exactly thoughts, exactly got moderna booster first day available me.  350/day, holy shit crazy. That's $1750 week $87,500 year. exception high-earning couples better financially one partner stay home kid.  honestly feel like calculated move didn’t/doesn’t appear “rushed” going data making decision. I, unfortunately, think going LOT vaccine hesitancy parents. Moderna vaccine 100ug, booster 50ug *unless* immunocompromised 100ug.

Pfizer booster J&amp;J booster vaccine.

Pfizer vaccine 30ug, asking 5-11 doses 10ug. called terrorism. need try obfuscate it. threatening terrorism get way. J&amp;J, plus antibodies sick 2020. I'm trying decide even get booster. Seems like Moderna way go do. I've always wondered WXYZ news would located. know. feel exactly kids, although high risk category girl.
And least live, parents level concern taking precautions do. We've gotten looks, 'it affect kids' comments, etc. keep trucking along. real challenge I'm hopeful soon better situation. Well, mother. doctors want date unplug basically. nurse said basically waiting ready. Apparently got worse morning well struggling, doubt long. Matter days. called work next couple days process.

Not gonna great. best friend ally world. Always back. I'm going feel real alone gone. imagine pharmacy staff could handling boosters childrens shots though many people probably get pediatrician review data quickly. want do, skim it? Really really hoping month lag real. would mean early December authorization, actually doesn’t feel far away would mean shots arms Christmas/New Years! booster dose 1/2 dose? really worried getting one, getting appointment. Yesterday 5 minutes out... Covid booster Flu done. Next week probably long wait responsible parents rush get it. get mostly Chinese vaccines?  densely populated countries done quite well pandemic. could say sky layer blueness see. ""the sky"", anyway? Alabama far excess deaths, they're delayed reporting covid deaths. Yeah, let’s treat like emergency anything. 8 months beforehand though? go 6? go getting booster - they? every CVS? Glad see republicans committed worst thing possible cases. mean, religious exemptions important respected.

The issue people requesting full it. get - post inspirational ""If God got us it, He'll get us it!"" memes Facebook prayed one time going health scare. show Bible says can't get vaccinated. Hell, name book Bible!   religion (other Christian Science people oppose medical treatment) stricture forbidding vaccination? 99.9% exemption requests flat BS.

I'm Atheist I've got dog fight. said, play devils advocate.

Islam Judaism forbids consumption shellfish. mainline leaders religions say vaccinations okay many conservative members faiths vaccinations (including limited COVID).

I've known personally least one Hindu take certain medicines contain ingredients cattle. sure applies COVID vaccine general.

Jainism (the religion nazi's stole swastika from) non violence, even microscopic organisms. Many followers use antibiotics example. Can't wait even though live States Sure 16% people who:

1. already covid immune
2. strong people get sick

How many people hospital, still? Like fucking shit. It’s sad even need conduct study like this. scools giving free horse dewomer bleach. credible link 2nd one, first even include source data fact one replies say exactly analysis flawed.

The 2nd link interesting seeing happen yet based data countries know measure things accurately. entirely possible covid19 different previous coronaviruses longer reinfection period maybe need boosters every year study suggests.

Even need annual boosters, see problem since already vaccine everyones recommended take annually called flu vaccine.

But point credible data showing people getting reinfected left right importantly severity increases happen. stop fear mongering. would something that's abstract arbitrarily defined like, give example? think they're different doses, approval affect supply adult doses.  Well unfortunately ACIP decided can't possibly meet week now, need wait another week bureaucratic delay. Got Pfizer booster saturday morning. Saturday night went bed terrible chills, Sunday sore joints brain fog/mild dizziness throughout day. all, symptoms similar 2nd Pfizer shot, completely gone Monday morning. shockedpikachu.jpg Roll (Covid) Tide Hmm yes floor made floor We're living  tries dominate every conversation

Your uncle hosts podcast? lol @ assets average earner America 2021. love Costco. door greeter sucker punch try get without mask. They’re ruthless. got enough work already. want promotion. glass Florida start over? America POV only: generation born 50s 60s reason say it. Sure climate change coming, average person didn’t know. could afford college part time gig. could live feed family four one earner minimum wage likely still able buy house. None true economy, stock market damned, fucked average American. You’re lucky live 1200sqft apartment two roommates able afford rent necessities college high school, find job all.  don’t want sued religious disability discrimination internal legal department determined would cheaper pay bonuses deal lawsuits. Depends define ""the sky"". talking physical layer atmosphere question, something abstract arbitraily defined? That's pretty inflammatory language kind reduction neutralization, least US. AZ vaccine, eh, guess justified.

Get mRNA booster scares you. T-cells save us.  Similar experience first two. got booster last night 6pm. Slept night, woke feeling tired almost hungover like. Headache body aches mid day. fever. Overall great like sick symptoms. Took Tylenol made big difference. Also, two young children husband working today aside lot tv manageable. I’m glad feel relieved. sequenced 4 times, last 5 months.  
This paper written one unusual spike proteins seen far. fda, first harm …  study tested Full dose Moderna half dose Moderna. valid given half dose dose authorized. hopefully fires employees don’t get vaxed. 👍 bit digging seem contagous important note daily case rates, that's many students catching day. 50 million school-aged children US, numbers hold nationwide, would translate 43,500 children getting Covid masks vs 25,000 masks. That's difference 18,000 kids every day, or, words, million kids Christmas. There's relatively low population immunity given 1.3 doses per population. started vaccinating 12-15s 2.5 months ago, even considering first doses under-11s. 

Of course cases going rise vaccinate more. Hey, everyone freaks out, understand variant sequenced total 4 times, last 5 months. interesting variant super unusual spike protein appeared Tanzia, country testing, people travelling another country hardly testing. know really extinct point, one /absolutely/ getting paper due spread expectation take world.  
AY.4.2 still variant appeared journals/media due outcompeting regular Delta. need study whether masks work lmao. run sink mask, remove mask stream water it’s wet, works. country ? Sad American GOP antivaccine rhetoric spread Canada infected healthcare workers there. heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 vaccination, previously shown augment neutralizing antibody responses VOCs compared corresponding homologous vaccinations [7, 10], might offer robust protection A.30 variant. 

Phew. let's hope contagious Delta. Agreed. approved back end July start getting shots arms August. FDA desperate need modernization reform. something high profile COVID-19 vaccines can't imagine much they're delaying progress vaccines life-saving medicines things front page news. Bingo!  Yeah np. thing weird armpit pain. Aside normal sore arm fever, kinda feelin tired.  

Haven’t caught I’ll gladly get 4th pfizer better options come out.  Yeah they're dumpster fire right Tell governor _______ shit brains. Fill blank. He's moved cross country times before, definitely knows what's involved, also likes kvetch lot, toss up.  mutations/lineages/voc's ""worse"" ones came them. basically progression. random new variant that's worse wildtype based months-old research likely land high scale. worse Delta we'd noticed rising prevalence months ago. sure, understood agree.

I'm criticizing all, I'm interested topic hand. might least worries point : can't comprehend stupidity either, hardly ever fear. Wearing mask become symbol team on, ""tribe"" belong to. pretty crazy politicize basic health precautions, crazy expected days. Perfect. Enough coddling.  No, right somewhat specious, good news.

It might question tweaking vaccines, might susceptible.

Life *will* go Yeah meeting summer used logic, look happened. 

That slide refers males, estimate (which expect lower 12-15 age group due potentially lower testosterone), model w/ lower estimates 203-78 peak COVID numbers.

Also, take account fact need vaccines ages we're going actually reach anything approaching herd immunity reduce spread significantly -- hospitalizations. may get voted, me... would take kid get done. like undone 🤷‍♀️ US 6x population UK numbers 9 months dated. 

I'd hazard moreso lack care regard masks distancing childhood obesity. Imagine cleaning large numbers certain famous flavor jerkward every single level government. Fed. State. County? City? Tried write comforting answer, removed automod question is.. deadly? contagious? vaccine provide protection hospitalization death? pseudovirus testing answer questions. Per 100,000 kids **per day**. That's high transmission rate: all-age rate peak US 78 per 100,000 per day. Scale increase whole US extra 100 kids per day landing hospital. Lmao ""at alarming rate schools set fire needing closed due fire damage"" Thanks, I'm looking schedule mine soon curious might  test actual live virus BSL3 what. know pricey pseudo typed virus studies usually pretty accurate but...  [CDC's list specifically says list contains **examples** workers may get booster shot, hard fast list. Now, would agree nothing example list jobs seems close accounting really self-identify risk. believe high risk workplace, state that. 

They also list factors may affect worker’s risk exposure virus includes:

* levels community transmission virus causes COVID-19 (so live area community transmission, basically get booster matter what)
* COVID-19 vaccination, Adherence prevention measures (e.g., wearing masks)
* Unavoidable frequent interactions possibly unvaccinated people outside household. 

So really unmasked and/or unvaccinated people office interact (or customers/clients), could reasonably claim workplace result higher risk. think list really could guide give anybody plenty cover get booster think high percentage workplaces unmasked unvaccinated (or both) people either working present site. meantime found official announcement started using 28 days definition; know hard believe, trying troll death person laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test died within (equal less than) 28 days first positive specimen deaths positive specimen (including post-mortem) counted regardless cause death, restricted based time frames listed above. aims provide comprehensive measure mortality burden wonder many deaths caused kids covid-19 everyone's like ""the kids fine!""  Pf Booster exactly 6 months felt close second, took fever reducer time bit better. 

Also developed pain arm, side vaccine. Apparently happen cause lymph nodes go high gear. went away days bad tbh chose protect that’s problem. Nobody, especially kids, should
be forced wear mask protect people won’t protect themselves. That’s ridiculous. seen similar comments every article/post covers variant super mutant, yet life gone on. 

Things really aren’t grim make be. parents grandparents time get vaccinated

I definitely agree there, time - everyone strong immune response vaccine (or Covid). people immunocompromised even vaccinated, amount strong immune response could die. Many (most?) breakthrough infection deaths types patients - immunosuppressants, cancer, etc.

Since vaccines strong protection infection first 5-6 months, would fine allowing vaccinated students mask. However, practical reasons becomes hard police another challenge teachers.

I think requiring masks outside bit extreme. time end year holidays spread, splendid I'm feeling like massive punk got mine soon possibly could without bribed. selfish douche, could bills.  Well, get scary. let's go back questioning whether restrictions schools meaningful based actually observed. explicit list people qualify based jobs, comprehensive list people qualify based examples occupations workers might increased risk exposure virus causes COVID-19. **This list include potential occupations worker could increased risk exposure.** Individuals talk healthcare provider personal better worse, written subjectivity. mean COVID coverage, costs paid (e.g., deductibles, copays, coinsurance) follow normal rules policy. Unless I'm missing something?  ""Gunshot victims tend larger number gunshot wounds shot.""   terrifying words English language are: I'm government I'm help. Ughhhh badge idea sounds like something 1940s Numbers released governor’s Office Financial Management show 3% state’s approximately 63,000-person workforce covered mandate left jobs.

Another fine reminder people reasonable. unreasonable nonsense gets amplified via media represents single-digit percent antisocial trash humans. There’s Dairy Queen around corner pediatrician always get blizzards, or, kids call them, “snowstorms” I'm thinking silent reflux acting night. Time go back dreaded wedge pillow. Ever heard really asserting include car crashes cancer deaths am.

OK, provide evidence stop wasting time. no, ambiguous formulation website it. Especially excerpt ends ""and based cause death reported death certificate."". clearly differentiate cause death, kinda disproves point already. US, able ask third dose even qualified group, pretend getting second dose?

Here Canada everything tracked, province knows exactly vaccines when. go online system book vaccination, let get third dose unless one special approved groups.  Question....I originally got J&amp;J, got Pfizer booster today....do need get second shot Pfizer booster effective, first shot enough?  reported cases would go shutdown naturally right? people less likely visit doctor get diagnosed. way worried people missing cancer screenings making likely would find cancer later stage. 

Ofc symptoms would bring office. guess regularly scheduled screenings took hit fewer cases caught early on? 

Because many women Gonorrhea symptoms mistake bladder/vaginal infections, maybe reported cases missed. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Yeah that's today. sounds like J&amp;J immunity waning, I'd rather get mRNA action.  would vaxed United workers know someone is/is not?

Easy -- force workers decide provide positive vaccination status bright red badges. badge would show vaccination status technically refusal provide positive proof vaccination. Vaccinated pilots flight attendants shouldn’t forced work people refuse protect people around them. isnt slam dunk , one slides, infection rate low ( seems trending USA ) , vaccinating everyone save 21 covid hospitalizations , cause 150 myocarditis hospitalizations

Even peak covid, saving 250 covid hospitalizations, causing 150 myocarditis hospitalizations

These tough trade offs , probably makes sense cases rising kid comorbidities , close Sounds like king tiger end? get life back? go concerts festivals again? wear mask ever again? actually enjoy life again? end restrictions sight end life certainly is. want life back. want live  wonder same, especially CO. get people replying human element, vaccination rates, etc… states politics degrees adherence trending differently Colorado.

The US steady downward clip since latest peak early September. Virginia spiking down. California spiking down. Florida spiking down. Ohio spiking down. Texas spiking down. Colorado rise? However, mitigation factors include masks certainly appear beneficial reducing spread (which surprise).

I guess understand even needed point. difference case rates study pretty small given fact children already really low risk, parents grandparents time get vaccinated, within weeks school age children access vaccine, understand can't let kids get back normal school life. seems unnecessary almost cruel point schools requiring kids. 
   
My cousin's kid 1st grade wear masks times including outdoors, events school activities cancelled, social distance even allowed eat cafeteria together. sit desk 15 minutes eat put mask back on. ridiculous feel terrible them. stuck (Alabama) 44% fully vaccinated, hospitalizations went almost 3,000 600 3 months.
Also positivity rate went 29.6% 6.1%.
I expecting another wave holidays. would recommend sleeping well day vaccine, least. 

There several studies flu vaccine show subjects sleep deprived PRIOR day much lower immune response vaccine vs well rested.

Sleep enhances efficacy vaccine. Lack sleep stress immune system leading less robust immune response.  saw recent study saying effectiveness J&amp;J vaccine decreases significantly 2 months by, think said 6 months, effectiveness could low 3% probably two-dose vaccine along. originally got J&amp;J vax almost 7 months ago became eligible ""booster"". However, since long, according study, seems pretty much immunity left boost, feel like need booster; need re-vaccinated since I'm essentially unvaccinated time. I'm confused do... get another J&amp;J shot 2 months, get booster Pfizer Moderna? get Pfizer Moderna booster now? confusing... know else used anti-vaxxers push agenda? Anything fucking want literally make shit already. mean kind saying that, difference negligible think data even supports mask mandates making much difference.

The data shows without mask mandates, 80 cases per 100,000 students, mask mandates we're 50 cases per 100,000 students.

Most schools &lt; 1,000 students

So we're looking average difference 0.3 students school 1,000 students.

(Rounding down, average school, we're looking average difference 0 students per week...)

Then also note disclaimer ""districts mask rules may also prevention measures (vaccination, testing, etc.) reduce transmission levels.

And record, start school year, strongly favor mask mandates schools. kids' school mask mandate, still choosing wear mask. Data like shows risk really high school though. Obviously, COVID outbreak, start wearing again, then, worried choose stop wearing mask. Pfizer first second. First felt like someone punched arm pretty hard. Second knocked ass day (felt like wearing lead blanket dentist day). noticed side effects third? Maybe handful districts make everything mandatory. districts/states let parents opt vaccines without much filling form stands now. SUX.
Not antivaxers, applies vaccinated well.
I suppose matter time, man inflation kicking high gear, covid hospitalized hurting health wallet.

I know lot people socialism, IMHO medicine education covered Good point. I'm guessing staying course dose likely safer choice well studies. mix match really adequately studied unless J&amp;J mix. seems reasonable deny COVID-related costs unvaccinated -- willingly making liability insurer consequences. paying small percentage vaccinated people end hospital really painful insurance industry.

Between broad employer mandate, perhaps we'd actually reach herd immunity. job prospect massive medical debt might work pretty well.  Good point, knows.

The approved initial doses Moderna 100 mcg Pfizer 30 mcg.

So Moderna dose 3.33x Pfizer. However like Moderna 3.3x better Pfizer. difference pretty small.

Wife (30 37) got yesterday. United States CDC recommends getting full 2 rounds FDA approved vaccine unless got mRNA based vaccine outside US would get mRNA booster either Pfizer Moderna.  ""prevent"" mean ""reduce less 50%"", sure Got Moderna booster late day yesterday, felt generally fine earlier afternoon feel tired weak.

No amount sleep seems like enough, weak tired.

Nothing complain really, felt 2nd shot gone next day. conveniently forgot previously infected individuals. truth is, vaccines don’t prevent infection. see exponential increase time? Cuz don't. We've got hippies, gays, drugs, that's sure, we've also got virulently oppressive hateful Christians too. Moderna first 2 shots. bring good point weighing benefits. think I’ll wait till November 10th. 7 month anniversary second dose. split difference get then. It’s close days probably won’t matter might well. family member got Pfizer got booster day available. gotten Pfizer would well day of. 

Thank response! 

-Cleatus Fetus news: water wet. I’d love know passenger.  herd immunity supposed happen around 70%? Well way threshold province.

We 'way over' threshold. 75% people BC fully vaccinated. Vaccination geographically homogenous. Many communities still falling short original 70% goal.

Unfortunately, 70% herd immunity threshold original variant COVID-19.

The Delta variant infectious result herd immunity likely around 80-90% fully vaccinated.

The vaccine protect people getting transmitting virus. people less likely catch virus, vaccinated people are, less likely transmit virus. can't transmit something we've never caught. “vaccine causes magnet” people might use “evidence” Totally agree. going happen anyways. Vaccine reactions happen, it’s rare, happens. vaccinate large group people it’s inevitable. make decision based DATA? cannot make everyone happy. it’s approved parents pressure vaccinate kids anyways. give choice parents now? Honestly, keep dragging feet I’m going get suspicious something going kids vaccine may hold getting kids vaccinated. point I’m ready give accept get covid (which likely already had) move life. Well look big brain here. thing remember biology really shouldn’t tell girl like wear lot makeup.  look data, masks manage decrease infection rate even 50%...   federal decision unblock EUA. fully blocking age group getting vaccine right now. LFGGGGGG! Indeed... parent 7 year old. Vaccines enough. need be. something forever. That’s good point! 7 month anniversary November 10th. think I’m going split difference get 3rd Moderna shot then!! 

Thanks response! 

-Cleatus Fetus pediatrician's office anticipating approval 3rd already scheduling appointments 4th later. would assume getting vaccine sometime 4th. me. Can’t wait get daughters vaccinated. Since pandemic I’ve disgusted hug kiss them. Also know vaccine provides additional protection already infected. 40% still vaccinated armchair scientist expecting 3 weeks well.

Maybe acknowledging need boosters 6 months anyway? study never find anymore claimed - convincing - antibody levels 2-dose vaccination correlated nearly perfectly chance infection, correlation severity infected. correlation [applies smoothly across clear data reinfection, seem work way all. Antibodies never high infection vaccination, also decay slowly, chance reinfection measurably risen. strong implication infection leads enough cellular immunity either prevent infection fight symptoms appear.

Antibodies used they're really easy measure. blood titration tests, simple blood sample diluted reaches cutoff virus neutralization, get precise ""value"". measure individual antibodies looking specific proteins blood. 

Cellular immunity least important, though; can't measure well. B cells make antibodies, all, cells might even important detecting infection killing infected cells. phase 1-2 studies try measure cellular numbers, results rarely consistent.

We know cellular immunity compares infection versus vaccination. know much third doses raise it. know long lasts. Still, order magnitude difference would see vaccine vs vaccine comparison. funny read headline think ""1 time honest mistake"" none statistics numbers get shoved everyone's throats media political shills faulty straight false. Please person reading this...try thinking let's fix America.  fucking sky also blue! Except not.

Exhibit A: Nick Rolovich think delay really timing meetings, perhaps reviewing something next week? understanding FDA gives approval, CDC figures administer.

This article helpful understanding approval process. U.S. FDA CDC convene advisory committees comprised independent experts provide advice recommendations broad range public health issues, including drug approvals.*

*FDA ask VRBPAC members vote whether vaccine approved, population. agency approve vaccine question, CDC ask ACIP committee vote best administered Americans. committees, simple majority vote become panel's recommendation.*  know vaccinated people COVID. One seriously ill hospital. going happen pop% gets vaccinated goes up. hit theoretical 100% vaccinated, 100% cases breakthroughs. mean vaccine work.

Frankly think Pfizer/Moderna update shot reflect dominant variant, that's me. clarify.  
You kids debating “water wet” “mask effectiveness”. also, infection rate children pretty damn low general regardless mask status. Even worse group less 0.1% Ha, without sound pedantic, water actually isn’t ‘wet’. makes things, wet. I’ll shut up. Same, went three three Pfizer. seem worth mix match. Yeah call pediatrician say anything planned yet. I'd imagine they're also cautious areas well might lower levels community spread Yeah, seems hard estimate since presumably lot adults died Covid infection transmitted child, would still gotten Covid way hypothetical alternate universe children treated carriers seriously. greater visual evidence different life watching Taskmaster versus [New remember reading approve guidelines administration Actually, conclusion opposite...that kids get infected easily adults.  looking 60 cases per 100,000 vs 40 per 100,000. way lower general population whole.  wonderful. could get dates younger kiddos... breathe sigh relief 1 4 year old get vaxxed. used call fat kids day /s Fortunately us, stayed awake biology high school.

Viruses reproduce sexually, no, meet baby. vaccines special category medicine requires CDC approval? Obviously CDC get involved cholesterol medications.   People produce level immune response vaccination, either -- that's there's recommendation 3 doses immune compromised. study cited previously compares 0.05% infection rate (50/100,000) 0.08% infection rate (80/100,000). technically true, one might argue mask policies appear large impact total infection rate. [Down syndrome affects (0.14%) live births (141/100,000).  clear, makes 100,000 enrolled population, average 20 kids tested positive. 100,000 kids, 0.0002% versus 0.0005% non-masked schools. important note last year typical year. CDC cited 1 pediatric flu death last year: quite apples apples comparison. That’s used place share bed haha. might end investing one position ones split up.  That’s thing makes sense, although weather probably makes difference well. Well certainly would expect sucker punch child. choices Americans make food trash. would nice see dataset vax mandates included. really. anyone explain exactly CDC different FDA approval? don’t understand takes 7 days. one attitude. Masks divisive intrusive life END.

Acting like bad people want keep mask mandates forever. Don’t accept it. Vaccinated individuals hosts. dude ran like 100 slides quick succession fringe studies like lol wtf. Hitting 100% also normal.  Right?

""40% kids may already covid wonder necessary"" well shit maybe wait two months rare side effect there'd less kids infected. Maybe backwards country  isn’t required. Remember herd immunity supposed happen around 70%? Well way threshold province.

Also, remember vaccine supposed protect getting transmitting virus? Yeah… UK give transplants people need them... situation here. 2yo went daycare days went back work March 2020. childcare vaccine available adults babysitters time since lot scheduling gaps. tentatively scheduled go back February 🤞  committee made 18 physicians phd’s. don’t know “rich” makes them. business person rich, probably comfortable super-duper wealthy. fields long enough accomplished, would categorize “old” though. half men half women. white. director Prabhakara Atreya, Ph.D. indian-American women. 

I don’t think committee touch want imagine them. that's privatised healthcare system sucks Haven’t states already passed bans vaccine mandates? feel like doesn’t snowballs chance hell mandatory across country. may come regret it, well. Good luck hope everything works fine you!     Disagree, own. Wait. Wha? Wait...does mean masks might work?  9 year old excited compared Christmas morning. saw picture Fauci news said, “is Jesus daddy?” told her, “it might be…it might be.” insane they're worried mandates barely states blanket mandates, let alone one 12-16 younger cohorts. Let us make choice, gather data figure 6 months. case fatality ratio hospitalization rates amongst children actually highest 0-4 age group; despite age group lowest per capita cases (except 65+ latest Delta surge, group disproportionately vaccinated). anything, younger kids need vaccines most. There's herd immunity Delta children. R0 (5-10) great vaccines effective enough preventing transmission (70%?) without mitigations. 

Reinfections occur little 3 months. hope vaccinate many possible, apply everything get Reff 1: masks, ventilation, filtration, rapid testing isolation. stay vigilant cases drop zero stamp outbreaks. 

The current strategy letting rip simply work lead needless death misery. 

Also, there's evidence quite recover infection, even mild one. immune system compromised. I'm even going mention long Covid complications. optimistically, people refuse get vaccinated still get residual immunity last time got it, making less susceptible catching spreading it. vaccination that's going keep spike like last year's happening; reduced pool naive hosts virus infect. 

By way, mean spike all. unlikely like triple-tined spike saw last year Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's celebrations coming little crest within larger wave. guidance changed Pfizer Moderna boosters. They're approved seniors, immunocompromised people health conditions, people high risk settings. People got J&amp;J broadly approved get boosters. think whole world quarantine lobsters. 

We ensure plentiful baths available full hot boiling water enjoy themselves. Ok. good day! immunocompromised getting ""additional dose"" rather booster think full dose. Australia (apart Western Australia) abandoning covid zero vaccination rates hit ~90% adults double dosed (which hit). rejected. idea people getting idea rejected. attacking you, one said recently. 

The FDA approved Pfizer boosters first Pfizer applied first. Moderna J&amp;J applied later. groups eligible Moderna Pfizer. J&amp;J expanded eligibility signs two dose vaccine. Maine lobsters remember

Worst jj reaction swollen lymph node. mild side effects moderna far. shoulders hurt I’m still well. It’s probably necessary children keep safe. also missing point children spread others. allows mutate. know, know, you’ve gotta consider others becomes apparent. Hopefully recover quickly. Honolulu Zoo [lost due virus. science universally favor third doses since [moderna's initial n=20 phase 1 almost three months ago, even month ago much it. predictable entire time FDA/CDC would yet another complete 360 go ""we see evidence boosters third doses"" ""everyone get three doses"". Right we're middle part process, still calling boosters (another dose counter waning immunity) third doses (a third dose substantially raise immunity overall).

[The mass real-world probably single convincing argument. Cases began plummeting pandemic essentially ended within 2 weeks opening third doses general population, happened Alpha/wildtype every country first doses back spring. total 7 under-60s severe covid country three doses. [Pfizer's phase-3 even stark: third dose increases efficacy symptomatic COVID 96% *versus two-dose regimen*. within last 11 days, national (some) state health departments scrambling keep up.

I may seem biased here, I've simply following research beginning. Get third dose soon can; protects others ultimately end pandemic. Gov.

Well covid Rt kept 1 virus disappear time. Difference commitment keep Rt 1 requires less stringent action immediate covid zero would less politicized. ethical. Yes. specific disease. Considering it’s killed US pandemic. wars matter. somehow possible get 3rd full dose (100mg) Moderna booster instead 50mg one? not, safe assume 50mg still likely create antibodies Pfizer's 30mg?

My goal get maximum level protection possible, even cost painful side effects. things please disapproval society's bottom feeders. Never pass opportunity shit day. Hey, like know everything. That's I'm asking.

But saying, based combination of:

- real possibility serious side effect, and...

- enough proof vaccine effective enough (I mean, I'm sure it'll quite effective, assume required effectiveness put real dent pandemic even higher) justify risking side effects...

We forced give vaccine children? Got flu shot moderna booster 4 hours ago. Got J&amp;J April. Hoping side effects mild. basically reaction J&amp;J really starting dig grave point. hope you’re least 6 feet away. It’s big deal. back August. Memory T-Cells somewhat overlap memory B-Cells function. said, provide memory previous antigen exposure appear involved quickly body ramp cytotoxic T-cell Helper T-Cell responses re-exposure. 

Memory B-Cells cells remember produce antibodies antigen. allow body rapidly ramp antibody production case re-exposure. Don’t think id go far call “great human” considering allegedly puppies enough cellular immunity certainly prevent infection (always matter luck, need one CD8 cell find one infected cell start infection kill off) get head start reproducing more. Enough circulating B cells start producing antibodies rapidly infection detected, potentially fighting infection within first days. Enough CD4 cells detect infection sooner flood bloodstream communication hormones, activating B cells triggering production immune cells types within blood marrow.

There's substantial evidence antibodies infection (medium levels compared vaccination) correlate protection infection, protection wane even though antibodies do. implies cellular immunity must play significant role, can't prove know prevents infection entirely simply fights become contagious. 2-dose vaccinations cannot latter Delta, though there's circumstantial evidence 3-dose might able to.

Thanks meant link something, doesn’t seem worked. may talking read fine print website, actually says data 16 health departments, who, unless I’m much mistaken, initially ignored CDC collected breakthrough data anyway. Looking author was, could even published? higher degree scrutiny usual. True, unfortunately Delta changed game. good news though, Delta contagious, hard imagine another strain even infections. basically burned unvaccinated people, point vast majority people either vaccine immunity natural immunity.   would advise moving Illinois unless want pay outrageous taxes everything. reason people fleeing there. course, definitely research making move there. Anyone know 25 are?  article doesn’t mention it.  can’t assume ug ug equivalence two different vaccines. actual strong cost effectiveness evidence would one thing, absolutely necessary ls abusive. Strong urge buy Microsoft product, otherwise fine 😜 think rise winter, dramatic one, particularly areas high vaccine uptake. Masks probably help. mostly human behavior. seasonality. human behavior affected seasonality too. 

But point stands. happens cases start going up? 

Personally, CA/LA cases dropped lot. mask mandates. think lift 10000% sure pandemic ""over"" intents purposes. Removing mandates reinstate frustrating dumb.  Moderna primary series got half dose booster Saturday 11 AM. mild fatigue night sore arm following day, felt fine. today (Monday), arm hurt unless push hard injection site. 

Dose #2 worse. felt hungover following day arm hurt several days. data Moderna submitted support application 50 ug dose shows similar immunogenicity booster 100 ug dose.  


Vaccines don’t linear dose response curves. Sometimes lower doses even elicit higher responses. studies need done, can’t make assumptions. booster shots initially rejected like month ago sudden they're saying okay? I'm thinking getting booster work public facing job find strange originally approve it.

No, disagree this.

People going concert events indoors without impasse ""non-normal"" thing wearing mask going indoor events. one avoiding holiday gatherings planning Zoom holiday gathering one drive holiday gatherings. 

The rest true. mask mandates indoor many people mask outdoors, many people still work home (and hopefully continue least hybrid form). However one even ""cautious"" cities indoor gathering mandates even recommending indoor gatherings.   would provide protection covid increasing circulating antibodies. stands, protection good hospitalization death booster would reduce chances get first place. Hope go it! propose mask mandates lifted? 99% adults community vaccinated, offering boosters, now, when?

Covid isn’t going away, say random time frame (weeks, months, years, whatever) it’s completely arbitrary things safer vaccinated community. normal people There’s really 3 flavors/phases illness - flu-like illness patient feels horrible congestion fevers, pneumonia patient coughs tons might need hospitalization initiate 2-4L O2 stabilized full blown ARDS severe illness.

""Warning: Surgeon General one lung voicebox could still kick sorry ass."" exactly said head.  “stand Kyrie” don’t get close edge, might fall off.  FDA responds companies requests approval (or EUA).

I'll bet cops take deal like would dying come Florida, literally, Covid is. regions absolutely. India aggressive enforcement (beatings) regions pre-Delta.

Again. know vaccination reduces symptomatic breakthroughs 96%. clear causality. Cases rise fall random, despite may look like. rise slowly drop slowly start wearing masks season changes.

Explain states introduce new mandates restrictions change seasons saw cases decrease then. talking about? picked one belive medical science  Cases rise fall random, despite may look like. rise slowly drop slowly start wearing masks season changes. different curve entirely - 50% weekly growth 30% weekly decline.

Edit: meant say second dose  Ok. Let's stay home forever.   know, makes sense. ""Cheaper pay right"" may well make sense.  
And makes sad. I've looking (mRNA first doses plus conventional vaccine booster) seen mentioned studies yet.   bad precedent. fire them. Thank   It’s week. Yes, 26 kids died COVID week, that’s small price pay order accommodate busy schedules ACIP members. Yea! remember seeing interview Adam Savage saying conference. Can’t find clip anymore.

The whole ""you vaccinated worry others"" narrative lame af.
If spread others could get vaccinated, mutate fine, that's case it, lot idiotic dip shits grasp fact. want 5YO get ASAP, wife not. Wife states data reflect anyone outside U.S. might well continue online learning cut short school attending day half, go home lunch continue online something. Well shows mask mandates benefit right? helping? hospitals overwhelmed covid patients something want encourage?  spend long online stumble posts falsely claiming Covid vaccines causing kinds frightening side posts take figures context safety monitoring databases, record health conditions experienced people weeks records cannot tell us whether caused jab.

This part somewhat ironic, considering UK defines Covid fatalities people died within 28 days positive kid 12+ going vaccinated COVID Walgreens CVS gave us runaround. also tried get flu shots both, Walgreens help us CVS took hour waiting despite making appointments advance. think they're overworked they've lost best staff they're getting burnt out, bitter people. contrary, went local hospital good sized vaccination clinic friendly got things done immediately kid.

As far booster concerned, wife went recently got booster hospital questions asked. 65 immunocompromised condition seems qualify risk neurologist suggested getting booster.  answer yes questions pertaining eligibility receive follow-ups them, least Walmart got booster at. (But also medical alert tattoo condition pharmacist might seen.)  cuff list respond snarky comeback. 
 
Thank well thought reply; make valid points. 
 
As compared EU (MDR, etc), FDA progressive areas cited. 
 
I feel opportunities increased collaboration - inclusive modernization appropriate - accelerate improve approval process. 
 
It still 20th century process follow. getting booster want one qualify. don’t really qualify plan waiting.  talking directly you. I'm agreeing saying HEY GUYS wash damn hands touch face that, plenty kids age immunocompromised high risk EUA give us option get vaccinated. Right socially distance wear masks good.  I'm also surprised vaccine locations turning people away based personal interpretation booster eligibility rules. totally experience large commercial pharmacies like Walgreens CVS.

I think likely based using out-of-date booster eligibility rules ""personal interpretation"" current rules.  completely understand you’re coming concern something I’ve spent long time worrying too. They’re decent grandparents though know keep mouths shut covid many things disagree about. husband made clear longer welcome around kids try spread agendas. may like boundaries we’ve spent years enforcing finally actually respect them. blasted high-wind, freeze-on-contact misting.

This actually happens significant degree. FDA often helps guide studies ensure results address issues have. Speaking personal experience, study wrote required FDA/LNE-GMED input approval could start full-fledged study. clear communication of, pre-alignment on, outcome / efficacy thresholds alignment updating acceptable risk profiles side effects vs outcomes

You think people problem now, imagine new data makes drastically redefine/tighten acceptance criteria. want effect happened requested 2500 additional enrollees trial due risk myocarditis huge numbers complaints (despite correct move). end, would benefit be? final acceptance criteria things evaluated would change appreciably would likely paint corner evaluate risk properly. delivery analysis data real-time parties

Due nature process, analysis data whole set actually dangerous. end HUGE mischaracterizations occurring. learned early-on let data scientists handle perform accurate sampling, possible, early data easy generate false picture. use 21st century statistical / AI technologies data analysis

No offense uses whole lot words say whole lot nothing. chemistry, equivalent ""the outcome reaction results interplay physical electronic effects"". 

The people performing analysis using modern methods possible. amount analysis behind scenes absolutely incredible, building models, processing data various constructs, etc. get feeling, believe presentation flashy (which actually useless need give data rich presentations). 

As AI, use cases totally inappropriate bleeding-edge scenarios. Despite people think, turn AI problem. need datasets, need train model, etc. etc. nigh impossible train model even know data says yet. add tens thousands orphans start edging closer real impact children. Personally, like bribed candy. would take vaccine anyhow, I'm turning free candy. Cases shot school started. Many districts shut beginning due outbreaks. Anyone else Sputnik light? 80% fully vaccinated population around 5M people still leaves 1M unvaccinated. SG virtually zero cases early August, around 3k cases per day. could sustain case rate long time pool 1M new hosts. Walgreens asked questions, check box. 5 9 yr old excited. want travel (we live cross country family), want normal stuff do. youngest high risk can't wait. champs comes flu shots least worry that. Hmmm, could’ve foreseen Yes, right. Credit credit due. CDC data alone supply sufficient evidence masks work. extrapolating countless peer-reviewed empirical studies that, along data, exactly that.  could ever known? Another way looking would chart cases thought transmitted within school building. 

Our large suburban district fairly well vaccinated (fairly liberal area). ongoing cases, doesn’t seem spreading within school. seem arise outside school &amp; don’t spread. 3 kids different schools, feel like morbid game testing-whack-a-mole…

Fingers crossed though, unvaccinated child (outdoor) playmate get notice close exposure (a fully masked) class. kid got it, mine likely gotten too. I'm pretty sure agree others telling ask doctor, believe recommendation six months. sure recent infection would matter terms whether get booster recently might impact get it. NYC denser positivity rate fell 1.33% days ago.

Density end transmission. performance art getting weird. Water cannot wet wetness ability liquid adhere surface solid. That's awful. I'm sorry. Wish something could say bring hope, sometimes life plain sucks. partial mask requirement? Like, pull mask nose? teachers wear students? Science verifying many us suspected. important unsurprising.

edit: many, I'm sure got information 8 months. yes, get booster places like  Roughly 700 American children died COVID far, really question if, when, every unvaccinated person gets COVID.

Yes, problem news outlets reporting relative immunity levels pfizer vs moderna booster (including mix match) based recent NIH study. study used 100ug dose Moderna booster - isn’t yet good data available 50ug dose especially comparison mix match.

Even ones wearing ""medical masks"" 1 inch gaps sides around nose see rest face. masks definitely keeping everyone safe, question that! Exactly. Majority people wear garbage masks wear properly never fit. Even ones wearing ""medical masks"" 1 inch gaps sides around nose see rest face. masks definitely keeping everyone safe, question that!  agree. problem much data immune response Moderna 50 mcg booster preceded Moderna initial FULL doses. 

The data Moderna presented FDA 2 initial doses Moderna 100 mcg followed booster 50 mcg.

Back Moderna trials Phase 3 (before authorized): looked 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg 250 mcg doses.  found 250 mcg toxic. lower doses LACK sufficient immune response. 100 mcg selected OPTIMAL dose. 

The rationale Moderna half dose folks got Moderna earlier already exposed enough antigen, need small boost jog immune memory, also wanted minimize side effects.

However, questionable folks got Pfizer J&amp;J earlier. immune response NOWHERE near robust Moderna's.  believe, prescribing half dose Moderna may leave unprotected.

CDC Director Fauci said - people shot booster UNLESS got J&amp;J.  However, reason, FDA still allowed Mix match. stance? observational analysis shows increase covid school aged children. insanity drives people? there's anyone votes No, bet Meissner. He's little bit ""off"" catch drift. don't, read bit. whaky, made mostly comment elsewhere thread downvoted 16 times minutes.....

Places partial masks going high vax rates compared places none. understand concept. understand could little compassion fellow humans. People scared. sides. 
A lot personal choices end landing people hospital. Food choices cause obesity, cigarettes cause cancer, let in, made choice!! 
Maybe let vaccinated get blood clots pericarditis because, well, knew risks!! Especially that, also, school even need parental input regarding things like critical race theory, 1619 project, teaching evolution? parents think want, able think critically objectively important child's intellectual development. STOP especially Reddit.

ive getting groceries store pretty much whole pandemic small leave doors open ventilation self-checkout. also 'seniors hours' first thing a.m. store cleaned thoroughly night. go right seniors time

however, even clean environment, cashiers obviously wearing shitty store-logo mask given two years ago. dont fit, dont wash them, arent certified good masks, fabric.

is masks keeping everyone safe? obviously😒 People get mad spread debunked misinformation again. research proven wrong yet still spread misinformation pretend smarter everyone else. nothing game. mask certainly won’t offer great protection environment people aren’t wearing one. reduce ability spread Covid. majority environment wear mask, ability Covid transmit severely reduced. 

It’s really complicated. Covid spreads people don’t want take simple precautions protect fellow man. okay? obvious control variables could influencing trends figures. differences communities, would pretty stupid believe that. Unless I’m reading data incorrectly, looks massively insignificant 75/100,000 students getting COVID (that’s 0.075% unmasked students getting COVID) vs. 45/100,000 getting masked. study also provides zero data hospitalization rates contact tracing measures.

I’m public health, incredibly weak study use advocating school mask policies.     Kids spread diseases like wildfire, spread parents grandparents high risk. New York. guess (without reading!) direct correlation covid spread areas schools masked, main driver this. course spread schools masks high percentage places like Florida high spread...do study schools Suburban CT. vs Suburban CT. something like easy time getting booster local public health vaccination site. something like area? Yeah, obvious high number cases causes masks mandates disappear. effect also happening past, making quantum 4th dimensional tunneling shit.

Or yeah, might also genetic makeup create superior human beings require masks, also responsible higher case reporting.

And water definitely wet.  know isn’t answer you’re looking for, studies aren’t meant prove anything someone who’s ostriched head sand. cognitive dissonance doesn’t get absolved studies. Instead, studies like publish increase body knowledge whole topics like COVID-19, studies highlighting what’s relevant, observed, hypotheses confirm/deny, areas future study needed. (some?) humans, findings confirm general critical thinking observational skills already knew. It’s still important quantify data using scientific methods research. damn, that's dumb lol think far we'd drop theater data shows many unanswered questions... importantly behavioral differences likely related mask mandates schools. discussion dose timing?  looks like extending time doses better (for adults anyway).   


Is anyone planning kids? schools mask mandates also chose instal UV-C sterilizers ventilation systems? idea Delta got China first trough Nepal, country borders India peak delta wave. coming Mongolia, Russia borders country huge delta wave... that's geographic question, political one. Probably similar long term covid vaccinated. Less likely happen still possibility. ""having kids world situation foolish""

""our parents could said thing""

""our parents reason say kids current world situation would foolish, inflation worse can't buy house""

do think valid reason boomers would want children, would financial difficulties?  900,000 hospitalizations 63,000 massive difference… oh no. could possibly seen coming? Unfortunately, without studies (even observational ones), know look for. 

Now officials look see factors contributed. Maybe school districts mask requirements higher vaccine rate don’t. It’s important know cumulative effect also matters give exceptions things even real? might well give exemptions anti-vax beliefs least grounded realm possibility certain degree. Bingo. 👍

you correct. . Im glad Reddit finally waking this. Masks4All really messed people's heads There’s surprisingly broad list underlying conditions qualify healthy young people six months booster, even things like depression, ever life smoker, moderate asthma. There’s list CDC‘s website.  difference initial effectiveness, like primary series difference durability. think main take away study that: chances astronomically rare-- however, chances developing issue 0. 

It difficult diagnose early stages, caught treatable. Respectfully, matter China borders India? common people cross land-border, fact border involved relatively frequently military standoffs. virus blow wind across, much likely variants come Chinese returning countries. damage already done Me: Hey it’s 90% chance showers. grab umbrella.

They: Umbrellas don’t stop thunderstorm. You’ll still get wet. rain come sideways. Even raincoat won’t work hurricane. I’ll take chances skin God gave me. cousin said it’s going rain. weatherman wrong last week. 99% people caught lightning storm survive. Lol ""study""... really case correlation = causation whatever want be.   Reddit would allow sticky posts. Thanks! That's stupid idea. make miss even school? meat:

In study, following first dose vaccine, were:

38 extra cases (compared baseline risk getting condition) GBS every 10 million adults Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine

60 extra cases haemorrhagic stroke (a bleed brain) every 10 million adults Pfizer vaccine

Meanwhile people coronavirus infection, approximately:

145 extra GBS cases per 10 million positive test

123 extra brain inflammation disorder cases like encephalitis meningitis myelitis per 10 million people

163 extra cases myasthenia-like disorders (immune conditions affecting nerves muscles) per 10 million people Logic hard find reddit... often correlation = whatever causation want here... Since care hospitalizations, kids rarely hospitalized, they've content dilly dally delay things over.

This could done months ago ordered expanded trials go hunting exceedingly rare side effect covid causes way often usually mild, advice American Academy Pediatrics. *still* enough participants catch single case trial. 

Like APA said, could followed expanded cohort post-market analysis, need delay rollout, since plausible harm could even come close worth risking getting covid instead.   would guess genpop boosters discussed pediatric EUAs addressed no. fuckin. way. /s  quite work like that, boosters believed work large part due time allowing body adapt it. Studies shown 3 Pfizers produce much higher antibodies 2 moderna (and three Moderna much higher 3 Pfizer). Pfizer also less side effects. read back last two years mask promotion find fit catagory.

All Pfizer's 30ug. combined shorter time Pfizer's first two doses what's believe cause reduced efficacy compared Moderna. 

I think Moderna ideal choice booster 2 doses Pfizer. I'm getting 3rd Moderna tomorow Yes, general opinion amongst almost everyone able understand basic facts. canonical amongst tasked managing public health response every country world. 

It also much common sense person working definition things like 'virus' 'mutation'. supporters 'vaccine nationalism' usually choose ignore obvious fact go directly emotions stopover reality. I'm saying hassled busybodies overstepping authority, especially children already attended school. heard happening cases. certainly need permission anyone. Provided parents give children education suitable age, one's business except theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

Our two children never attended school cannot recall anything achieve this. hassle local authority. Since know specifically country talking and/or provided realm numbers talking can't answered certainty. 

I know part USA, similar vaccination numbers (83% 12+ fully vax) peak August/Sept, recording around 80-90 cases per 100k per day. vast majority came elderly (65+) known waning vaccine effectiveness (they vaccinated Jan/Feb) unvaccinated.  air? like job. want guys actually part all. seem content absolute bare minimum make excuses. times seem work yell them. don’t even think study. looks like report summarizes data. doesn’t appear analysis upon quick glance. certainly RCT. 

But yes, lot “this confirms previous beliefs must accurate.” end class, drop mic!

But, seriously, that's good suggestion. wonder people tried that. One old karaoke machines might even work.... majority vaccinated(or partially) old. makes sense. Right? It’s gross. Funding. target audience funding. Shady Thanks! :) I'm skeptical Oct. 26 date gave committee exact amount time needed review data. date calendar \_weeks\_, since Pfizer submitted data. Treating like emergency would included ability move meeting possible. FDA able put conclusions data last \_Friday\_. clear course pandemic M-F 9-5 culture FDA considered far important responding timely manner. Maybe time jump ship work elsewhere less stressful workload better coworkers time. Sorry, thinking talking US mainly, bad assumption make considering numbers gave.

I agree rollout vaccines less developed countries problematic maddening see people developed countries rejecting vaccine due idiotic beliefs.  country, corona getting worse despite fact people getting vaccinated?

In country 84% fully vaccinated. corona seems getting worse hospitals. corona rules also get strict. happen? noticed little strange, country happen worldwide? think strange. medical one may push edge pretty broad laws (which come place good intention).

Thank you. Yes no, school pay teachers well. parents pay, teachers get paid. leave job school now.

It shitty situation really think school annual contracted amount paid monthly. pay snow vacations well example. I'm still waiting someone explain one me. I'm going assume mostly exercised Trump supporting bible thumpers exactly bible prevents one vaccinated?? r/noshitsherlock     clearly didn’t control anything else studies.

The article tell indicates did. That's asked, actually report think guess whole details. ""refuses elaborate further"" meme taken hold laboratories IRL? would nice they'd allow visitors get cheeky booster arrival. Multiple reinfections common thing, living right now. vaccines approved ages over, unless new variant completely bypasses vaccines comes (extremely unlikely) 7 day ban shut idiot close social media accounts blokes constant menace Maine example. 17% week week, really flat 2 3 weeks. Even Arizona 35% relatively flat several weeks. eligible 6 months second dose.

The risk myocarditis greater covid compared vaccine. went public health department ask booster, asked 6 months out, filled self-attestation eligible Half people article healthcare workers spent pandemic treating sick dying people....


I think need re-examine comments coming gross certainly needs stop existing current form. Recklessly prioritizing site engagement public safety can’t continue. Already happened ivermectin meta analysis paper. still believe it. isn’t funny :( Allergies necessarily reason vaccinate. Many people, thousands people, vaccinated history mild severe allergies second scenario much “ saving them” saying necessary yet you’re risk severe disease, rare risk side effect isn’t worth it. . don’t agree criteria, that’s explanation.    parents could said thing. one glad didn’t. China either turn hermit kingdom follow path India living virus eventually.

While COVID largely behind India, much still ripe spread China.

Also claiming religious festivals ""created"" Delta utter nonsense. Prove claim rubbish.

Even 2.5m deaths true, would somewhere half way points terms deaths COVID per capita world, fairing 2-3x better US (depending whether look excess deaths confirmed covid deaths).  You’re idiot. kid important belief isn’t. someone doesn’t land hospital, doesn’t mean didn’t develop lingering health condition. go invest energy something else already. Yeah clarified. meant. Well argument. know enough say valid concern. Also think worried big pharmaceutical companies pull game get exploit world. know enough industry. things would different. what's floor? 5 anyone link actual study? I'd like read methodology.

Indiana 50% population fully vaccinated 7 day average case number still around 1,500 per day. reference 7 day average year ago around 2,000 0% vaccinated.

crazy... Good luck convincing group leading researchers physicians drop everything join group. Leaving behind academic post, high paying jobs, pledge treat sick, sit wait Pfizer drop data. cherry top, pandemic over, they’ll job. 

That sarcasm aside, part reason they’re qualified panel, frontlines research treatment, honing skill experience. panel full time nothing else except reviewing data, would bring full expertise needed. FDA employ full time MD PhD, review decision panel, usually follow recommendations. Water wet, sun hot, anti maskees silly else new? got third Pfizer mask looks like face, every time wear get positive comment reaction. starts convo person without mask wear mask remove possible infection pool best can. Saturday convo butcher shop customer. shows liquor store right afterwards dude wearing mask.

It work, conversations rare.   Twitch also done nothing stop certain streamer broadcasting views virus lab leak vaccines less effective infection. 

The guy actually apparently PhD neuroscience rants cherry picks way science papers like 3 hours time. really sneaky. message gets diluted I'm sure Twitch's moderation staff simply get it. 

In words, fired university job views. Lol feelings exactly!! I'm excited get 5 year old vaccinated. Pedantry gets ladies. Oh yeah.  boat, already told family need vaccinated bring kids around holiday season. close end, taking risks. Well starship gonna go anywhere don’t? Flip coin. Either mRNA vaccine great booster.  feeling 3 year old get vaccine 2022, makes sad. never would thought. Fuck, I'm sorry hear that. deepest condolences. Say Reddit I’ve reported seen removed worse vaccine misinformation site. never understand approval process matter many times redditor explains me. Global Pandemic mean hands deck full time vaccine research, leave important decision people full time jobs. Give pay focus full time. Central California got hit big storm weekend prevented reporting covid stats yesterday.

From state Note October 25, Due weather event Sunday, October 24, delay posting data. working situation update data Talk task want do.  Moderna give full FDA approval adults? hear anything anymore application rejected.

Full FDA approval relevant one wants doctor prescribe vaccine off-label, currently limited Pfizer. Please clarify:

A) get recommend

B) boosters farce

It sounds like mean A, think people downvoting like mean B. shit??? agree. heard Paul Offit criticize decision require increased safety data knew must kind ridiculous. basically said would need hundreds thousands participants pick safety signals beyond would see original study design. graduated Harvard Medical School researcher Mass Gen. knows he's doing. medically politically. incredibly little reason get booster.

By taking time post this, combined whatever time spend thinking it, could walked Walmart gotten one already. Seriously. getting kids vaccinated medical neglect. incentivize compliance executive order. vaccine supply, people administer vaccine finite resource, spaces carry program.

Also, pediatric version unfortunately comes ten doses per vial, 11 kids, that’s issue. 

Unfortunately, Pfizer/BNT didn’t make easy us pediatricians. Damn, still can't put stop pesky rumor spreaders? No, sunlight contains blue, colors, blue scattered color sunlight passes atmosphere, day, perspective sitting daylight prism atmosphere. Sunsets blue. Night blue. Sunlight blue, white light, colors combined. Mixing JJ mRNA seems work JJ first much way around though. think FDA wanting 4-6 months additional follow data (instead 2 months like adults teens) along lines wanting seem rushed. 

Especially since American Academy Pediatrics multiple experts field, including members FDA’s vaccine advisory panel (VRBPAC) openly criticized decision. Apparently major side effects present within 2 months group 2000 participants small assess rare side effects. 5 7 year olds also excited, hate shots! understand sleepovers friends, travel air vacation, go stores (I let tits minima can’t crowded place), Norma things like maybe indoor dining, movie theatre. kids high risk, all. I’ve never interested gambling lives manner matter. Yeah thought might general guidance missed, much looking personal answer suppose personal answer one be. Although banning people Twitter actually helpful. Different platforms moderate different ways set differently wind different cultures. tend agree whole platform shutdown wouldn’t probably move would go place. I’m really sure outcome would be. Denmark data already? updated studies, can't tell much complete not.  *Two Corinthians!* Sure makes sense, you’re asking random internet strangers personalized health advice. Call 24-hr nurse line back insurance card?  me, data shows increased quantity, frequency proximity people interacting enclosed spaces results cases. transmitted people either air surfaces touched.
Masks may fully protect it, neither vaccines. However, safe guards place help minimize impact. gf got J&amp;J 6 months ago getting Moderna booster Thursday. I'm worried much going kick punk ass due fact getting much sleep week exercising hard 'm pretty much running fumes point. probably needs perspective too.

I'll going Pfizer something seems like common sense mean true. always better solid empirical proof something even seems obvious. Yes, wrong. I've corrected it. believe main Pfizer trial? looks like 2yr-4yr group, 6mo-2yr group. Also looks like child doses 10 μg. You’re supposed actually critically think data studies. 

The current meta read title comment something witty like “water wet”. fuck! pay 340 USD kids Montessori kindergarten, privately owned run non-profit. rest subsidized government. Add long list I’m never moving US. Right insanity healthcare there. study also explicitly said designed show best combination was. 50 people arm study sufficient randomizations comparisons valid.  tested 100mcg Moderna dose, 50mcg boosters at.    141 beds 361 COVID patients. 40 years neoliberalism: dismantle government programs idea anything government evil, even government programs people's material interests. I'm guessing sarcastic comments thread look numbers lol. Okay, see benefit need. something mandatory? feel that’s highly unnecessary  good man, meaning lost translation. literally responded definition happened.

Fuck innocents hurt amiright. fault anyways born way. Zero tolerance yay politics. 

Only sith deals absolutes.  think so. forgetting showing data roughly two weeks, growth case numbers geometric. would expect lines masked unmasked keep diverging going future. time case numbers get really scary late much it. costs market new hires / onboarding / training instead vaccinated. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Just remember tested 100 mcg full Moderna dose 50 mcg dose used booster.

But course, data account health issue might have.

Any booster antibody count, mRNA ones boost J&amp;J. What's interesting J&amp;J mRNA booster increases level 3 mRNA doses.

Pfizer releasing data showing actual efficacy 95.6% comparing 2-dose people 3-dose people phenomenal, bit ""real-world"" antibody counts IMO. Antibodies thing work immune system science still hammering much influence actual real-world infection immune response.

I probably triple Pfizer local pharmacy stock know past side effects it. *95.6%!!!* No, like desantis, he's intelligent sociopath.  really see benefit mixing Pfizer Moderna

Especially actually infected. wife really getting stressed trying decide get Pfizer try Moderna suddenly went.... ""Wait... got Pfizer originally actually gotten COVID point. would change now?"" Settled pretty quick thought way. worked, stick works.

*Once Walensky signs off, younger children could start getting Covid-19 shots immediately.* read CNN meeting held November 2nd 3rd. thousands children dying, world would stopped. Two shots, three weeks apart; like Pfizer adults anyone talking mandates? EUA approval us waiting way long get kids vaccinated. care anyone else does. Decline certain areas, areas, increasing. can't general pandemic. Things handled area-by-area, whether mandates data.  CDC meeting next week. approval, vaccine happen Pfizer 2 shots, reduced dose kids. Shots arm nov 2-3 ACIP green lights?

I read shipments could start going providers FDA approval, nothing administered CDC gives final approval. Well yes aren’t saying children need vaccine they’ve infected.  Lead example...... even needed articles censorship goes media social networks currently? A.30 more. Outcompeted delta typical flu season, ~100 children die per year right we’re somewhere 2-5x mortality flu. There's people area literally started website ""unmasking children"". people study meant likely minds changed silly things like scientific facts. follow last point, saying vectored/mRNA combo beats 3 dose mRNA?

&amp;#x200B;

Its like reading data making conclusions considered kind superpower nowadays experts phd known personas able  That's ran various clinical trials determined serious side effects very, rare. really hope they're trying talk prove smart get shit together. Fingers crossed. Sure, make right. Whether interested discussion not, others might benefit seeing logic post right. 

I find website says Covid caused declining trout populations, I'm sure - mean much.  think narrows one mutation, they?  
It's got mutations seen ""interesting spike"" variants Delta, I'd think variants still pretty far away able learn tricks, even possible without losing advantages 

Link spikes Delta, Beta, Mu, C.1.2, A.30:  Really? thought initial trial Moderna approved vaccine testing done different doses, antibody response vastly different. it’s infectious enough spread. King variant one spreads thoughts people already pumping false information vaccines adults ready pounce anything. 

Anything related health safety children ironically get people thinking irrationally. guess really don’t want appear rushed way. Whats worrying they're focusing political implications actual preventing infection. Completely left discussion among old rich men vaccine reduce number quarantines schools, allow education continue minimal disruption. children bring COVID home Mild chills, soreness, malaise bit nausea me. Definitely want go anything could get lunch plant computer. second shot J&amp;J March. think data showed boosters safe effective, data, I'm saying think data really support saying Moderna booster better Pfizer booster.  booster better booster though. mean personally know cockpit airplane someone, I'd want know they're reasonably intelligent. alone would make want fly someone vaccinated. stupid pilot mix. legitimate medical exemption (which rare), that's one thing. they're easily swayed political propaganda get social media, they're probably stupid fly plane.

Hope get shit order focus scope. investigated host cell entry antibody-mediated neutralization variant A.30 (also termed A.VOI.V2), detected several patients Angola Sweden spring 2021 likely originated Tanzania

So floating around months now? storage simplified store fridge several weeks. Okay, immediate side effects? lol Whistleblower claims Pope Catholic Germany nothing don’t covid, I’ve traveled extensively year, go friends, everything would. things DO. you’re vaccinated don’t serious health problems, don’t give second thought getting sick, you’re fine.

I would certainly things could cancelled letting kids getting natural immunity, via covid. amazing they're overcomplicating binary question.  That's good keep mask mandate place everyone school certain percentage threshold, (say, 80%, currently Massachusetts) students staff vaccinated. agree outdoor mask mandates extreme, unless huge, tightly packed crowd.   appears better infecting lung cells escapes vaccine induced antibody neutralization better variants, far spreading like wildfire, appear high viral load fitness Delta variants have. mutations something watch variants, particularly deltas.

They're keeping eye vaccine based antibody neutralization escape increased fitness infecting lung cells combination really feared. Delta outperforming potentially god-send, speak. Listening discussion right now, several members appear resisting approval everyone age group, one reasons already high previous infection rate (over 40%) offers children lot immunity. problem one FDA seems taking responsibility role happening. recall, waited long time communicating need double number trial, ignored calls American Academy Pediatrics expedite approval vaccine. link really good discussion 8 different doctors talk lot kids pandemic, anyone wants message I’ll send honest cant decide based that. Better look studies data. Someone single Johnson jab might lucky get infected someone 3 Moderna jabs could get infected.  Also, chart says nothing children hospitalized. Yes see watched surge TX, LA, MS, AL move north TN &amp; KY stopped. Eastern OH started get wave never made W side. States around look great too. interesting map moves sometimes stops. parents live town 9K secrets know someone covid dies it. handful deaths &amp; hospital never overloaded. Several months ago know remember Pfizer representative mentioning 3mcg dose, maybe 6 months 2 years age group. True, would think people heard likely trust government thus likely look ""conspiracy"" theories Covid-19 Facebook cesspool. left saw someone get attacked local group asking simple question get Covid vaccine. absolutely swarmed anti-vaxxers. person runs group nothing. know literally copy paste, right? Google ""water isnt wet"" I’m really glad did. I’m enjoying life. feel sorry anyone can’t.  Duh! think LOT parents (at least ones I've talked to) weighing risk kids getting sick, risks long COVID, bringing home, bringing grandparents, etc. 

So probably right herd immunity per se, bigger individual hospitalization -- again, parents talk understand rare concerned negative outcomes. literally copied pasted part ""water isnt wet"" website lmfao.  results paper suggest, mutations facilitate viral mechanisms entry antibody evasion.

Efficacy Oxford, Pfizer, hetero-innoculation examined, indications given reduced efficacy either vaccine alone vs CoV A.30. combination vaccines[hetero-inocculation] associated higher efficacy vs A.30

the mutations appear vitro; confer inhibition vaccine induced antibody binding; enhanced cellular entry; enhanced pulmonary[lung] trophicity[targeting]

relative efficacies moderna; Johnson&amp;johnson; vs Oxford; Pfizer examined. I'm going get it. work company bunch folks give shit vaccines covid. 7 month old baby , wear n95 masks work, wife want catch risk giving LO.

So .... I'm going get getting per day information? Maybe I'm reading incorrectly, says cases per 100,000 enrolled students 7-day rolling average. nah course, parents chose selfishly kids carry family name leaving us hollow world try fix time consumed.  


Suffice say, disagree schmaltz considering terrible shit going on. I’ve heard rumors sun hot. Hopefully someone drop research money too.  It’s 6 months since 2nd vaccine dose believe qualify booster point take medication hypertension isn’t chronically control. I’m also 18-49 category. think wait general pop eligible booster, go ahead schedule? Dose size seem influence efficacy much side effects. chart calls 7-day rolling average cases. per day. Immunity work way.

If initial immunization produced antibodies, via causing number B cells specialize produce cells make antibodies.

If run antigen again, antibodies wane, B cells hang around rest life, ready churn new antibody factories needed. 

If get infected virus, B cells recognize virus start churning antibodies.

If get vaccinated again, also wake B cells they'll start producing antibodies again. Indiana pretty solid history accurately reporting cases though. article awhile back reported 1 3 schools even report Covid cases state. Indiana also history reporting Covid cases nursing homes. states surging around Indiana, I'd take given Indiana surging too. spouse's situation, would fill form incorrectly order get give booster, feel bad saying slam dunk ... 

even 203 - 78 slam dunk , especially myocarditis seems affect perfectly healthy kids , covid usually kids comorbities , much gotta weight personal situation 

i think parents going weigh hospitalizations much heavily herd immunity benefit correlation substance abuse mental illness easily explained majority time self-medication. Nobody's self-medicating getting COVID. Even waiting longer would give ""better"" protection eventually, weigh benefit increased protection two months risk getting sick extra 2 months lowered protection.

Personally, gotten pfizer originally, would get booster ASAP 6 months elapsed. show negative covid test every flight. Kind hard hide that. Also, regards fire example - same. 

Chemists define wetness narrowly happens liquid adheres solid itself. That's every definition, easiest one really narrowly define one argument uses. simple - solid wet liquid stuck it. Wetness descriptor specifically requires solid liquid. 

Fire same. fire thing, chemical reaction named. process takes certain form. Now, could say object ""on fire,"" wet, example ""can light something fire already fire,"" parallel ""can wet something already wet?""

You can't burn fire fire object. concept. shoreline object, concept. flood shoreline, moving shoreline back, destroying it. study finding getting vaccinated already immunity natural infection produced *extremely* powerful immunity. may already super-duper ultra-powerful ""hybrid immunity"". would probably get another dose level-up even more, really dramatic increase immunity people who’ve previously infected get least one dose vaccine,” said Shane Crotty, professor immunology La Jolla Institute Immunology California.  concerning variants, it’s literally 100 times better levels antibodies vaccination compared somebody natural immunity,” Crotty said. “That’s small change.”

It's shame getting savagely down-voted. People apparently think anti-vaxxer aware protection resulting natural infection, even though went get vaccinated anyways, discussing whether get *booster* not. Colorado different weather patterns ones listed though. Floria, Texas, Virginia, etc. insanely hot summer really nice right people socializing outside more. Colorado opposite. Alaska started peak big time fall weather hit people headed indoors dining social behaviors. factor big one. Standard answer 2 weeks booster. However, Pfizer's internal trial booster efficacy, began measuring 1 week booster given. 

So 2 weeks err side caution, could little 1 week. ""staying away crowds"" living lives? black &amp; white thinking never ceases amaze me. like there's nothing pretending 2019 total lockdown. family still takes precautions too, still living lives. Vaccinations helping, they're magic bullet pandemic ceased exist. people outside America never heard events pretty sure neither lot Americans. No, examples vaccines ""potential longterm side effects"" mysteriously show long vaccines happen. 3% number directly study. immunity *against infection* though; protection death *if infected* remains high 90%. short, immune system still knows fight virus, decided priority keep standing army ready it.

Get pfizer moderna booster soon can. research universally agreement vectored first dose mRNA booster best vaccine combo is. hardly matters one get. last long segment... stop listening frustration. ridiculous feel terrible them.

Me too. adults need step stop spreading covid kids masked.  think already know based language, still wanted point anyone else reads -- 

There's good chance AY.4.2 represents future evolution virus -- sublineages Delta couple mutations grant little bit advantage virus.  
Delta first variant truly taken world, countries remaining minority Delta point. likely future variants stem it.   doesn’t make sense all, government told us repeatedly vaccinated fully prevent becoming infected infecting others.  However, running beds concern pandemic. Like said, hospitals run near capacity. take much overload hospital system.  No, one factor teasing cause-effect relationships type studies tricky even possible.

However, mitigation factors include masks certainly appear beneficial reducing spread (which surprise). 

That said, even outside school mitigation factors, likely correlation public perception preventative measures vaccine rates. went Publix, (a Southwest U.S.-based grocery chain), COVID immunization worksheet fill specifically said immunocompromised under-65), called CVS, Walgreens, even doctor; said eligible. county state (FL) health departments CDC answered phone calls (we get voicemail run-around) answered emails. congressman said contact local health department, one getting back. frustrating. Legitimately first thought. Work home sparsely populated office can't conceivably place elevated risk?

But CDC qualify lot suggesting? explicit list jobs/industries. work office ""accountant"" list jobs. We're nor'easter right now.

I lived Cleveland while, lake effect weather wonderful. 95% totally possible 95%+ population vaccine certain diseases. States take hardline vaccines, know population get vaccinated.

Mississippi really good example. lowest levels childhood vaccinations made vaccines mandatory go school (No exceptions) one highest levels vaccinations. Mandates work. Soon dubbed Super Mario Bros Syndrome. Vaccinate kids, otherwise Bowser wins.    Shit give COVID vaccines $2000 pop. Hell Id $200. adults didn’t matter much main bottleneck production. completely different story. shit Sherlock downswing done burning. really kind people want expose kids to, though? It’s business family anti-vaxers covid deniers wouldn’t getting access children potentially spread agendas, vaccine not. Alabama can't let Mississippi stay number one. help. think extrapolating there. partial mask rules schools trending almost exactly fully masked schools, groups still seeing rising cases mask schools leveled off. Seriously also talking measures - assume schools masks mandates also stricter restrictions throughout school well. 
   
If small difference school operating like normal vs one mandates restrictions, given already low chances serious effects COVID children, argument schools operating like normal? **11th slide: ""Districts mask rules may also prevention measures contribute lower transmission levels"".**

i'm masking assume report inferes cause-effect regarding mask mandates. know help, can't whole plan. I'm sorry loss  shit i'm surprised. someone eli5 waves keep occurring? assumption people start taking seriously numbers go down. not, doesn’t stay burn out? vaccinated, probably take week get back ice, weeks. talking breathing in...

Oh, notice women see better men article. come surprised. 

So, OswaldXC says Blue, blue... science supports this. article states: ""What mean object ""red""? way perceive blueness neighbor? cousin? dog? Many scientists believe humans color vision generally consistent across populations cultures, evolutionary reasons behind constancy."" 

So, there... Oh wait, believe evolution. Never mind. far I've heard, trialed 3-week interval two 10mcg doses. [New York City COVID-19 Overall transmission fallen 28.7% 67.75/100,000, well way hitting threshold fall substantial moderate spread (CDC guidelines longer recommend masks vaccinated individuals point). borough level, Bronx already fallen 50/100,000 Manhattan Queens 60. Brooklyn also 100/100,000 first time.

* provisional 7-day average hospitalizations 50 per day 10 days 26.4% past week data available (this subject greater revision).

* day 15 deaths since October 10th, peak 20 September 7th yet seen since.

Right Moderna's ""half dose"" still almost double Pfizer's booster. would getting Moderna booster 50ug make less protected 30ug Pfizer booster? 

(I know dosages always greater==better discussing dosages here) it! believe that's final step. There's cases reinfections since start pandemic. know vaccine gives protection natural immunity previous infection. Seems fall we've known.  Surprised, not.  Suspend students previous vaccines. Problem solved. That's actually way higher thought. Ugh There's still much know COVID immunity holds up. would rather take chance getting natural immunity shield. want prepared. Unless kid. they're least understanding non-compliance. 

Anecdote time: two weeks ago kid ""accidentally"" lost mask way (I put quotes accident that's he's highly distractible, I'm surprised*he constantly losing everything owns*). Took 30 seconds notice theatrically cover face panic. 

We made way back Costco greeter apologized kid. greeter gave us disposable surgical mask him, mentioned know kids always keep mask on, known lose inside store boredom, etc. stress much (I still told kid take better care keep track masks future, losing screen privileges, afterward).  I’m sure know works. [you deleted post]( ).


but know can’t act like Covid deaths unacceptable kids turn blind eye respiratory viruses ways pose greater risk. shape policy prevent child deaths Covid, essentially saying need masking social distancing forever.  Also, one highest risks, even among kids obesity. many parents honest kid obese would take get vaccinated?  surprised_pikachu_face.jpg saying good thing children died, I’m putting perspective since media likes spice things expecting thousands deaths. Colorado rn, confirm bipolar weather! Question still one two shots kids? date CDC meeting next week? want put calendar! long almost 2 years, excited get 5 year old vaccinated! That's exactly thought, read whole thing there's clue goin contagious Big D. something looked weeks ago. I’m parent Australia low covid cases next deaths kids (none 10 years old) wanted find data consider whether vaccine needed little ones (too young vaccinate stage wanted understand numbers). data kids covid US. haven’t updated since 30th Sept would easy do:


This isn’t study rather summary publicly reported data child cases since reporting began current outcomes. It’s American Academy Pediatrics Children’s Hospital Association. summary, data 30/9/21:

Since reporting began (up 30/9/21) 5,899,148 children tested positive US. 

Of reported cases:

Up 30/9/21, 520 died (88 per million), 0.009% total child cases

Up 30/9/21, 22,429 hospitalised (3,802 per million), 0.380% total child cases

Obviously results aren’t complete 5M+ cases recovered deaths hospitalisations end higher currently reported, still shows low risk children. 

What data doesn’t show:
- age breakdown
- treatments interventions used
- underlying conditions (if any) children had
- sick hospitalised children (moderate vs severe)

Also, states reported hospitalisations (around half) needs taken consideration numbers would higher. children 18 died Covid 18 months died flu 2014-2019 US. go find data CDC webpage. watching this? different formulation?

I know full meeting youtube, 7 hours jump random spot anti-vax rant (not kidding). can’t believe put “only” sentence. unfortunate thing due geopolitical struggles, US China contesting influence SEA, see vaccines SEA much larger quantities say, African Caribbean states. would depend initiatives bilateral supports. hell mess badly? Inflating numbers 15x pretty significant oversight. actual number 90k couldve understood accidentally adding another zero 63? went public health department ask booster, asked 6 months out, filled self-attestation eligible.

There plenty appointments great news! Something remember final decision, FDA isn’t bound panel’s recommendation expected make decision within days. clinical trial aren’t even 999 participants? Unless CDC going reschedule meeting, safe say FDA done beforehand. honesty don't. fear FDA panel motivated politics science. fact rate deaths severe symptoms low glaring parents vaccine.

The UK panel experts declined approve vaccines 12-17 exact reason (it overruled later on). UK experts dumber US experts. Like said, worry politics guiding FDA, science. thought Colorado would one first states implements mandates. Also used anti-vaxxers push media misleading us Covid sucks

Oh yeah, totally in-good-faith assholes totally misrepresent science totally poor people here. probably going small number school boards try mandate right away, likely wait full FDA approval.  Maybe even boys too? Paying employees $2k essentially prove vaccination status beginning look like bargain companies… Getting everyone vaccinated isn’t realistic. wish was. 90% pretty good. Everyone discussion reason. CDCs word green lights providers administer 5-11 group? Can't wait get immunocompromised 8 year old protected! talking mandate point? EUA, IIRC. let’s last age group try move on. one other? spread misleading information present fact lose credibility. Nobody believe true evidence studies, lied to.

Simply type parent cares enough buy book implies (on average) better parent doesn't. 

This likely case here. schools care enough mask rules also type take precautions. I’m glad did. Retractions don’t get attention. missed retraction. expect mandates vaccine fully authorized. Yes flu kills lot kids age 18. makes sense vaccinate disease kills population. also kills lot people age 75.

I think find large numbers adults get flu shot either. risk death flu miniscule healthy adults.

But there's almost deaths even serious symptoms COVID 17. That's big difference. story misleading. question possibly got through? number come somewhere. So, what's next? 2 weeks? CDCs meeting already scheduled next week also, think FDA approving recommendation something ""wait"" for. I'm excited. Delta probably much game changer, think acts way faster previously infected/vaccinated people's memory cells react form necessary antibodies sufficient level counteract symptoms develop.

Boosters going necessary folk slower/weaker immune systems. fortunately lot nations overbought vaccines plenty go around boosters. can't tell serious I've seen people post zero sarcasm. goes...

We live binary world. Something fully prevent something order value. seatbelts save lives? Yes. fully prevent motor vehicle deaths? course not.

Vaccines greatly reduce negative outcomes among breakthrough cases. also reduce chance getting infected well reducing chance infecting others. Interesting adults need vaccine even previously infected.  give kids flu shot prevention flu reduce spread, especially household. kids died Covid last two years flu normal flu season. idea.    much misinformation one post. reason numbers add likely reading wrong ones. can't even figure dosing vaccine recommended approval, I'm guessing sources credible. Try find better ones. recommendation simply ok use based current data. much discussion regarding point would likely beneficial many kids already infection, would many scientists panel recommend requirement kids time.  FDA make immunization recommendations question approved written.  anti vax ! agree scientists say early mandate fully mandated immunization caveat made available parents doctors make informed decision regarding specific circumstance. don’t know live haven’t worn mask since June, mandate lifted, exception situations work. Yep. Literally say people anymore. ""Oh dumb. Hope survive next year. tried. time stupid anymore.""  Interesting guess little premature start talking boosters Sinovac Valneva.  country living in?

Oh okay- think people currently interested able get kids vaccinated, interest grow time sure. agree, I’ve told, looking country like Singapore, vaccinated country world, spike cases per capita case? allowed acknowledge singing particularly dangerous spreading covid fucking dumb yet? rubber stamped FDA, ACIP, CDC, I'm rolling pharmacy get kids shots like Maybe waive COVID costs vaccinated.

They really shouldn’t weigh political implications vaccine approval. FDA panel experts disagrees voted yes.

I'm convinced argument.

Chickenpox caused ""only"" 100 deaths year vaccine. Since vaccine there's 90% decrease deaths.

90 lives saved year worth it. signed moderna booster dose website local pharmacy. easiest standard meet BMI 25 30 (I’ve heard both), it’s like anyone actually weighing get there. We’re also eligible job puts us “increased risk exposure,” could also cover large portion population. also, one going asking resume. 

Personally, we’ve got Thanksgiving coming up, big trip week later, want extra vaccinated those. Otherwise probably wouldn’t huge rush this.  couple problems vaccine kids.

1) one trials, control treatment, got severe symptoms. **no data** say whether helps severe symptoms. know helps cold-like symptoms. really need vaccinate kids prevent cold-like symptoms?

2) vaccine known wane time. understand correctly, also giving children 1/3 adult dose second shot. efficacy levels start wane like J&amp;J, ie 3%? keep giving boosters kids every 6 months? illness 99.9% rate hospitalization kids, 2 million chance death kids? There's plan this, know fact issue. plan action this? 

I'm fully vaccinated, vaccinated health professionals. looked numbers know risk high enough would take booster. look numbers kids, add all. clincher Pfizer pushing vaccine even enough data quantify helps severe symptoms. exactly going get kids vaccinated know prevents severe symptoms, know efficacy wanes short period time? 

I give kid Tylenol chance might get headache day want give kid vaccine chance might get severe symptoms COVID, even know vaccine protects severe symptoms. Yep, true statements, safety data great, info still info. also wish gave time measure J&amp;J, supposedly type takes longer necessarily flop reputation gives. Weather patterns seem make impact waves virus. people socializing indoors (like Texas Alabama summer hot outside), virus spreads more. Colorado teetering point getting touch chilly lot places eat socialize outside, especially evenings. Texas, we're outside time now. I'm sure Alabama same. factor still factor. hear 100%.

On personal level, living life 100%, nothing don’t covid, I’ve traveled extensively year, go friends, everything would. things DO. you’re vaccinated don’t serious health problems, don’t give second thought getting sick, you’re fine. 

The masks restrictions another thing honestly something don’t think people talk nearly enough. live city mask mandate sucks. makes go lot less would. go gyms don’t require masks. travel internationally work restrictions hoops masks travel makes everything much expensive difficult. needs much bigger discussion exit strategies transitioning inevitable part covid part life. YouDon'tSay.jpg also PHE data series designed provide definitive information

Schools require masks also likely require 3 feet distance student unless outdoors, encourage activities cohort ""pod"" (no mixing grades lunch recess), minimize adult access asymptomatic. 

Source: two students school district mask mandates. 

Kids also go outdoor recess/breaks rain shine, one grade time, elementary grades lunch outdoors canopies school. 

Adults allowed inside school without appointment, monday (10/25) also required show proof vaccination negative tests older 72 hours entry (that's county wide requirement extends indoor amenities, schools). problem, thank willing polite discussion topic. mean? federal government authorizes approval vaccines.

I would follow guidelines area WHO. went booster right don’t think pharmacists would stop you.  finish line sight. Mine 2 I’m looking forward next age group getting specific timing, appreciate vaccinating 5-11 help everyone stay safe. Yeah next school year earliest -- we'll plenty data  Based vote seems like wanted talk show smart are. know subject blood pressure things like watching vaccinated DRASTICALLY reduces chance either becoming infected infecting others.  


It also severely reduces symptoms breakthrough infections.  


So, would like cockpit unvaccinated person 90% likely carrier, vaccinated person 10% likely carrier.

Hospitals already diverting — turning away —  ambulances emergency rooms fill, France said. 
“Ultimately, trying protect hospital beds,” said, adding, “Maybe really work harder businesses require masks ask restaurant owners ask proof vaccination.” 
When asked whether health department considering taking action itself, France said “possibly.” said agency also hopes local officials take steps curb spread virus. 
“We’re preparing possibility,” said. “We’ll track hospitalizations next week two.” 
Larimer Boulder counties already reinstated indoor mask mandates. 
A handful Denver businesses required proof vaccination enter restaurants, bars concert halls, mandates widespread. majority vaccine mandates — including one city Denver —  Colorado far focused government, school health care employees.

At worst point, Dec. 2, 1,995 people hospitalized confirmed suspected COVID-19. 
As Monday, 120 intensive-care beds available 88% state’s acute-care beds filled, according data. 
“We’re certainly worried hospital capacity medical surgical beds might capacity end November,” France said. 
So far, there’s sign worst over. state health department reported 15,260 cases week ending Sunday — quick rebound one-week drop. percentage tests coming back positive highest level since Dec. 16, suggesting even could undercount. 
In September, hospitals admitting 100 COVID-19 patients day, that’s risen average 140, said Beth Carlton, associate professor environmental occupational health Colorado School Public Health. fewer COVID-19 patients hospitalized worst point last year, hospitals dealing surge top normal mix people needing care, said. 
“It’s already pretty bad,” said. “I think could get worse.”

 
Nationwide, new cases hospitalizations dropped significantly, Colorado moved opposite direction, Carlton said. Monday, state 11th-highest rate new cases compared population 14th-highest hospitalization rate, according New York Times. 
It’s entirely clear that’s happening, several neighboring states northern mountains plains experiencing surges time, Carlton said. Cooling weather could factor, might surge one place spread undervaccinated communities spill people whose immunity might waning, said. 
Hospitals began diverting ambulances 10 days ago, move reminiscent scenes took place last year’s deadly third-wave. 
Public health officials especially concerned normal flu season could overwhelm hospitals. 
Public health orders issued last year address transmission coronavirus suppressed spread influenza. since lifted people began gathering often, doctors reported cases typical illnesses, common cold respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 
It’s unusual thousand people hospitalized entire flu season, might lead 300 people needing beds influenza matter months, France said.
